DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,3.0,"Booked a 1 King Bed Executive on the 24th floor and the view of the city from that high above was amazing. However, I had a couple of problems with the professionalism of the staff which is why I rated three stars instead of five. I can't help but make this personal and say that I wasn't treated with equal warmness and courtesy because of my appearance. Coming from a red eye flight, I arrived at the hotel with sweatpants and frazzled hair. I do have tattoos and I'm in my early twenties so I felt like the staff regarded me as not as significant as the other guests. I had a couple of rude stares initially and when I visited the executive lounge (which requires a key) for some breakfast I received an almost, ""Who let you in?"" look from the woman serving breakfast. With that said, the room service operator seemed quite irritated whenever she took my orders but the actual room service deliverers were quite friendly, so I made sure to tip them well. Food and beverage could do some work, it's the not the worst but definitely not the best, especially for the price. I had free wi-fi with my stay, so that was very nice and convenient. Overall, I would stay again at the DoubleTree in Center City just because my stay wasn't awful but the staff definitely needs to brush up on their services techniques and courtesies. Just because someone is young and underdressed and has tattoos does not make them less worthy of respect. My money is as good as anyone else's.",0.09419540229885057
JW Marriott Indianapolis,Indianapolis,3.0,"The hotel was beautiful as we stayed there for a conference AFLV. 

Wait Staff Review 
The main reason I leave this bad review is because of the banquet staff. Our waitress was very rude and not accommodating. Our waitress ignored one of our members could not have asparagus or he would die. We mistakenly forgot to get a meal card for his allergy we had on file for the conference. She said he did not have a card (piece of paper) that would not allow her to make any adjustments or alternations to the meal. This is a conference of almost 5,000 ppl and not all 5,000 were at the banquet. A vegetarian plate could not be swiped out for the chicken and asparagus plate? Or a plate brought out without asparagus? This makes no sense to me. After she told us no, I asked another waiter and he explained to me no accommodations without a card because of their supervisors. He apologized but said it was not allowed (he was nice). Once our waitress saw I asked him, she scolded me and said she was my waitress and not to ask anyone else. Then proceeded NOT to attend to our table of 12 people the rest of the night. Empty water glasses and plates, were then taken up by another waiter much later. I can understand that they have certain rules placed on them by their superiors but the way she spoke to us and reacted was up acceptable. Not to mention we contacted AFLV and they said they received similar complaints from people. So JW Marriott please have a conversation with your wait staff, we can understand policy but somethings are exceptions or at least speak to people with respect.",-0.023549783549783543

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"To be fair, we were here to chaperone a group of high school students at the Florida State Thespian Festival.  It was a mob scene for 5 days.  That is a difficult situation, and I think it is fair to grade the hotel on a bit of a curve...

That being said -- it was still a 2 star experience.

Check-in was awful.  Some of the rooms were not ready until after 7pm.  That caused a lot of difficulties.  I know there were a lot of check-ins, but it wasn't exactly a surprise to the hotel.

On the second day, the hotel deactivated all our hotel room keys for failure to pay the first night's parking fee.  Really?  Sounds like their problem in not securing incidentals with a credit card, which we were happy to do.

The hotel ran out of extra pillows.

At least one of us did not have maid service at all on day.  We went down to the front desk for fresh towels at least, but were told they had to be delivered.  Unfortunately, the towels were never delivered at all.

We specifically asked the front desk staff not to issue replacement keys to students -- so the chaperones could control room access.  They did so anyway.

The hotel gift/sundry shop closes for an hour in the afternoon for lunch?  Really?

Finally -- the Starbucks in the lobby is the slowest I have ever seen and the staff is quite rude.

We have to make a decision on where to stay next year.  Despite the wonderful location next to the convention center -- I don't think it is going to be here.",0.032824074074074075

JW Marriott Indianapolis,Indianapolis,3.0,"Giving them the benefit of the doubt-wish I could do 2.5 stars.  The hotel is quite nice, very good location.  But my experiences with the valets and bellhops dissuaded me from even trying the restaurants, bars, or any other amenity or service in the hotel.  The place got transformed into truly just a bed and a bathroom, which is unacceptable at those prices.  

The valet system and bellhops have a system that forces tips.  I refuse forced tips.  I even had a bellhop RUN and pull a luggage cart out of my hand when he saw me push it myself.   When I told him I can push it myself, he ignored me and started walking faster.  As soon as the valets found out that I can park my own car, they reminded me that I can charge valet plus tips to my room fees, 6 times.  As in, they reminded me 6 times.  Wanna push your own luggage cart?  Think again.  They will gladly send one up to your room, even though you clearly walked out of your way to come get a luggage cart.  Sorry JW Marriot, but the relentless fishing for tips isn't indicative of a high service level, it's indicative of a hustle.  I didn't even want to deal with waiters, waitresses, bartenders, etc at that point.  I just wanted to stop being seen as a 'mark.'

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"*do not stay here*

Oh how lovely to wake up Tuesday morning and be peppered with insect bites after sleeping in the second bed in my hotel room at The DoubleTree by Hilton Center City Philadelphia. What else is lovely is how rude and inconsiderate the staff has been on the matter. How they have the nerve to say to me, ""where else have you been?"" Where they have the gaul to lock me out of my room as I handle the matter. You told my boss I was angry and making a scene and drawing other guests into, which is absolutely not true. Why? Because I'm a black woman? Maybe I should have made a scene because clearly the diplomatic route is pointless. Where they insist I am lying because they can't find a bed bug when they ""inspect."" Absence of evidence is not proof. You know what is proof? The bites in these photos that I did not have Monday night when I showered and went to bed, but definitely had Tuesday morning when I woke up and now on Wednesday are swollen enough to make movements difficult. Where they send a man to a woman's room to come and inspect my things who then mansplains to me about bed bugs. The service at this establishment is already awful and I could let pretty much all of that slide, but I have been HARMED by this hotel and the staff's behavior is just kneading the harm. I have stayed at this chain before and enjoyed my stay (Scottsdale location is stellar!), so I was looking forward to my stay at The DoubleTree by Hilton City Center Philadelphia. Apparently my expectations were too high for even subpar service. Whatever happened to, ""if you're not satisfied with your stay, let us know and we'll make it right?"" So reads the sign in all your guest rooms. I did let you know and you belittled me, embarrassed me, ignored me, locked me out, and then gave me a sack of your cookies on my way out the door. I've had better experiences at hostels! Time to call the Department of Health. BUT FOR sleeping in this bed, at this hotel, I would not have hot welts the size of my hand on my torso and I wouldn't have to burn all my things. Now I am making a scene.",0.00940917107583774
Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,4.0,"I came here in desperation for a new hotel after experiencing the worst possible scenario. Thank GOD this place had a room-especially since there was this huge drama convention going on.

Some of the front desk girls were very helpful, but one of them in particular was very sarcastic. Like I was having trouble getting the wi-fi and she managed to fix it, but with all these drama kids going around and about, I can tell she was getting a lot of complaints about them, so I told her she's doing a great job. She laughed sarcastically at my face and blew me off like I was the bad guy being sarcastic. I mean, I have friends in the hotel business and I used to work at a hotel-I know how crazy it gets, but that doesn't excuse you to be a total bitch infront of a customer.

Anyway, the bartenders were awesome and so was the kitchen staff in the morning for the complimentary breakfast. The spa was great and having a view of the marriott and the bay was beautiful.

The location was very convenient, too. Lots of restaurants and tourist spots to stop by-hell, you can even take a jog around the place and everything looks amazing.

As for parking-I wouldnt put any money on valet. You're better off parking your car in the garage yourself as I've heard a lot about the valet being really rude.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,4.0,"First off - YES, I liked my overall experience, and some of these peeps are giving an unfair review (example: One reviewer thought the restaurant was crap, but didn't say why.....I actually thought it was pretty good for a hotel restaurant - I ate there 2 nights in a row and enjoyed my Salad (although they put too much oil/dressing on it for me - was a bit soggy) and the burger the next night was very good - quality of the meat very good. No complaints and I am a total foodie. Just sayin'...

THE GOOD:
+Raphael R. at the front desk is a personable guy and the other front desk nice too
+ Great breakfast for the money - bacon, eggs, hot cereal, cold cereal, omelets, etc.
+ Free drinks in the bar from 5:30-7:30 (Happy Hour on the house) - NICE touch.
+ Beautiful hotel - open center so you can see all floors and great view from elevator - especially at night
+ Nice large rooms. Almost too big for my taste since I was traveling alone and don't really use the 'living room' area.
+ Workout room small but good enough - equipment has TVs in front - nice touch.

THE BAD:
+ Walls are a bit thin if you know what I mean (happy couple next door)
+ Internet access is $15 (shame - they should just build it into the cost of the rooms and call it good - nobody wants to pay extra for things like this when it's such a big thing to clientele but such a small thing to comp - c'mon, ALCOHOLIC drinks are more expensive then Internet - why not switch and give free internet and just ONE drink free to guests instead of all the free drinks they can consume between 5:30 and 7:30pm?  That would justify having BOTH internet and giving a free drink and EVERYONE'S HAPPY.  
+ Pool was out of service and being worked on. That alone should be made up by perhaps guests getting free internet service!

Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,2.0,"If you are going to Philly and wanting to see historical sites this is an excellent location.  The rooms are clean and the prices are what you would expect to pay for a nice place in such a desirable location.  

The thing this place needs to work on is service.  From the bell hops, to check in to the concierge to bartender to the waitresses.  The manager should be put in a historical stockade because if their service and attitude is that poor throughout the entire hotel it must stem from the leadership.  

We got out of our car and the bell hop told us how to take our things out of the car and he told me to move my tailgate so he could maneuver around easier.  He told us valet was too expensive but he had difficulty describing where we needed to park and it was two blocks away.  

At check in we were told our rooms were not ready but it was our fault because we needed to have rooms next to each other.  She wasn't the least bit concerned the rooms weren't ready.  She told us green at some hotels means one thing but at this hotel it means no maid service at all.  

The rooms are nice and large.  Beds and bedding very nice.  Bathroom would've failed the q-tip test.  The air exchange was disgusting.  Water is free with two bottles, but sitting right next to a large bottle that is $2.  Looked like a set up!  Wi-fi is a charge, typical, but not always.  

The gym is just a few treadmills.  (Not that we expect a full gym but this was less than hotel average.)

The club didn't open until 5:30 for happy hour.  It may be 5 o'clock somewhere but not at this place!  Snacks were not replaced at night when you need them.  Breakfast is slim pickings but expected free cuisine.  

We asked the front desk a simple question about National Park tickets and she directed us to the Concierge Desk.  He was talking to another employee and they made us wait forever to finish their conversation.  Then he seemed bothered.  

After a concert we returned to the hotel around 10pm for a night cap and the bartender didn't say hello, didn't smile but told us that this would be our only drink because he was shutting down.  Not very smart, we tip well, and there were a dozen people enjoying the Olympics and spending money.  

So the bottom line is this...this is a nice clean hotel, and in a great location and priced right for the area...HOWEVER...the staff and service are so rude it was a struggle to even give 2 stars.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"Stayed here in July for 2 nights (daughter's college activities) and thought the place was pretty good given location, price, amenities, room size and as everyone knows, the chocolate chip cookies.  Although not a huge issue they have no TV channel guide so you wait several seconds each time you change a channel to see what channels they have and what might be on....irritating.

Fast foward to this past weekend (August) when I returned (daugher's college move in) and could not have been more disappointed.  Not sure if it's a fire regulation or not but the space between the floor and door bottom is HUGE.  Why is that an issue...you can hear every conversation in the hallway by the people who think the world around them wants to hear their every word.  Why are people so rude?  The hotel can't filter out rude people but I do expect my hotel room to get me away from them.  Okay, #2, the room smelled very strong of ""room freshener"" and a bit like cigarettes.  I would bet the previous occupant smoked even though it's a non smoking hotel.  Gross.  #3, the smoke detector was pulled off the wall and hanging by it's wires (previous guest unplugging it?).  #4 Urine stains on the floor around the toilet.  #5 the hot water handle on the sink fell off and was laying on the counter.  No hot water available in the sink.  

After drving 7 hours I was too tired to deal with it and just went to bed...on further reflection I should have changed rooms for the ""freshener"" smell issue.  But I didn't.  Trying to be helpful when I checked out I handed the hot water facet to the front desk...figuring that might get their attention to fix the room.  I told them of all the issues.  They were very nice about it.  I was not looking for anything in return but they offered a discount on my room....they took 20% off.  Not sure how I feel about that...on one hand 20% is better in my pocket than theirs, on the other it seemed a bit ""light""....I would not expect ""free"", after all I did use the room, but I would have thought 50% was more appropriate....but whatever.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"Our group was traveling to Tampa for a convention and we booked through our convention reservation block who sends all the information to the Embassy prior to our arrival.  The Embassy looked like a great option (even for the $200/night price tag) since it was conveniently located across the street from the convention center, had free breakfast (with fresh-made omelettes) and happy hour.  However, issue after issue plagued our stay.  

First, I called two days in advance to change the checkout date of one of our 4 rooms.  The reservations attendant was very short and rude, stating that I was not able to change the date of departure within 72 hours of check-in (I was under the impression that it was able to change within 72 hours of the date I was wanting to change).  I also made the request to change one of our King rooms to a double.  She informed me that I had to contact our block reservation coordinator to change it.  When I contacted the block coordinator, they were unable to change anything and called the Embassy to follow up.  The block coordinator was also not able to have the Embassy reservation coordinator make any changes, although double rooms were available.  Lastly, when I completed my call with the Embassy reservation coordinator, instead of sending me to the survey where I could express the poor customer service I received, I was sent to a timeshare calling center.  

Upon arrival, I was charged a $25 package handling charge for a small box.  I've stayed at over 100 hotel properties and this is the first time that I had ever been charged a fee for a package delivery.  I was not provided with a HHonors gift bag as other HHonors members were.  We were also notified that the fitness center and pool would be under construction for the duration of our stay.  The Marriott facilities (across the street) were available for our use, but no one at the front desk could tell us the hours it was available or if we needed any additional information for access.  

My room was on the 3rd floor and I could never find a staircase.  After looking at the map, it seemed that the stairs were located outside, near the pool.  The same pool that was blocked off for repairs.  If there were a fire, there was no safe egress path for me to exit which was a serious lapse of safety.  Plus, the elevator was excruciatingly slow during peak times.  My boss waited nearly 30 minutes to get from the 14th floor to the lobby.  

The Internet did not work for more than 5 minutes in the living room portion of my room and did not work at all in the bedroom.  

Upon checkout, I noticed a $24 fee for valet parking was charged to my room.  I never had a car.  Luckily, I noticed and the front desk staff was able to remove it.

The only positive experiences we had were the breakfast and the location convenience.  The breakfast staff was overly friendly and accommodating, especially the podium hosts and omelette chefs.  There is a bridge that connects the second floor of the hotel to the convention center (but you can't access the third floor without using the elevator).

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,3.0,"It's a bad thing when a hotel sits on an excellent location and just phones in everything else because it can. I was less than impressed with my experience.

Here are the positives. The front desk staff was friendly and the room was clean. There they are.

Here is everything else. The valet parking is expensive, inefficient and my two contacts with the valets were not good. The valets were rude and very slow to help. The breakfast opened 5 minutes late and was quickly overwhelmed. I understand that the chain's model for breakfast can be challenging. That said, they need to make changes beyond warning other guests that teenagers will flood the place and suggest alternatives. Our room was quite loud from the elevator machinery. This is an architectural/engineering issue which should be addressed.  Our experience in the Trolley Restaurant and the in house Starbucks was less than satisfying as the service was not what one should expect. Trolley's was slow and the Starbucks staff could not operate the oven which resulted in no hot food. We were forced to deal with the hoarded at the free breakfast.

I've stayed in this hotel several times and the experience has been consistently mediocre. I prefer the  property across the street, but it is often booked up first. As my travel plans are usually""spur of the moment"", I'll probably be forced to stay here again. I hope they change.",0.0019871794871794946
Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"I stayed here a few years ago. My room was clean and cozy aside from the roach issue (read my other review). This stay was different. It feels as if the property has gone down since then. My room had an odor like mildew or mold that we couldn't seem to get rid of with air freshener. Also, when you turn the water temperature knob to a certain point, there would be this loud, continuous noise and the knob would start to shake rapidly until you turned the knob slightly to the right or left. Problem was, that exact agitated point on the knob was the perfect temperature setting for me so I always had to have my water either slightly too hot or too cold. Very annoying. But the main issue we experienced can't really be explained by the hotel staff. We were two families, in two different rooms and both families experienced allergy problems while in the shower. The water from the shower seems to burn the eyes and almost immediately after the eyes begin to burn, severe sneezing begins. I initially thought it was the hotel hair conditioner but at breakfast, my cousin asked if I was feeling weird while in the shower. He explained the exact same symptoms but he had not used the conditioner. Then a woman who was eating nearby overheard our conversation and she said the exact thing was happening to her. That night, I was rinsing my daughters hair after swimming and she began to cry and said the water was burning her eyes and then she began sneezing as well. This morning I heard my husband sneezing while he was in the shower. I went to the desk and asked about the water in the hotel and they looked at me as if I were crazy and said they have never heard anyone complain of this. Weird, we all experienced this and we weren't on the same floor. The woman was staying on the 18th floor and we were on the 4th. Can't say the water made my skin feel any different but my hair certainly did. It felt hard and wiry after shampooing and so did my daughters'. I blame the water for sure! I can't understand why the hotel staff are saying they've never heard this before when it seems like a common occurrence. Morning breakfast was ok...much better than a lot of other free breakfasts. They have an omelette station and a small hot buffet with scrambled eggs, potatoes, bacon, and sausage. The area gets crowded at times but they have a sign near the elevator that lets you know the high traffic times for breakfast. Most of the staff was  pretty nice in the hotel except for an overzealous young guy at the front desk. It's not that he was rude...he just has a ""know-it-all"" way about him that came across as a little annoying and especially since he decided to jump into the conversation I was having with another desk person and give me an answer that ended up being very wrong. I don't think I will ever stay in this hotel again. There is a Marriott across the street that I normally stay in but Hilton Honors sent me an email with an offer I couldn't refuse except whenever we went to the desk to inquire about the offer we had, no one seemed to know anything about it. Overall, the stay was a little bad and I don't think I'll stay again.",0.03412842712842713

Holiday Inn Express & Suites Tampa -Usf-Busch Gardens,Tampa,4.0,"A little hesitant to book due to other reviews. Contrary to whatI read our room was clean and actually very roomy including mini fridge, microwave, table/ chair, even a keurig. Took away a star because upon arrival there was sock in our room. Ewwww. Additionally upon arrival, I was told that check out was at 12 and I could call in the morning to inquire about late check out. When I called in the morning I was told check out was at 11 and I could have until 12. Miscommunication much! Exact words "" I have someone checking in that room and need it cleaned as soon as possible"" ok? A little rude. Anywho, I'm sure I won't be back but would recommend if you're going to Busch gardens, super close and a lot of food in area.",0.06607142857142857
Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,3.0,"I just stayed here this past weekend for a wedding. I have never been to Philly and don't really know much about it, but I did think the location was pretty nice - it was walking distance to a lot of sight seeing places, and also a ton of bars and restaurants down 2nd street, Walnut and Chestnut. The airport is not too far either, but it is a whopping $28.50 flat fee. I thought the decor inside was really nice too, and the wedding reception/cocktail area was nice. The beds were also super comfortable. I did not go to the pool or the fitness center, so I can't comment on those.....

But now for the negatives:
1. The workers there were generally nice, but the waitresses at the reception were downright rude! they would take my drinks when they were still 1/2 way full without asking if I was done with it and on multiple occasions I was NOT so nicely asked to please move - they pretty much would push me out of the way when there would be plenty of room to just go around me and give a lot of attitude.

2. The price per room is very expensive - it's like it's trying to be fancy, but it really isn't. yes the lobby area is beautifully decorated, but the rest of the hotel is pretty much like any other 3-star hotel. The bar/Taste restaurant is nice too, but the drinks there are ridiculously priced! My husband got 1 beer and I had a vodka soda, and our bill was $20.

3. You have to pay for wi-fi in your room, which is also very expensive ($10 for the whole day I believe), but they do have a business center with free wi-fi. However, I can't comment on it, because the two times we went down there to use a computer it NEVER worked! we would put in our last name and room number like it asked and it would stall for a good long five minutes! and then it would say, ""cannot verify your name or room number"" or something like that.

4. The other thing that SHOULD have been a convenient amenity but wasn't, was the express check out on your TV. I always like to do this if it's an option to, so that I don't have to wait in line at the front desk, but when we went to the TV channel to check out it was completely fuzzy and you couldn't read a thing. Why even have it as an option if it doesn't work??

5. But my biggest complaint is that the walls are SUPER THIN! Both mornings I woke up at 8:30 in the morning to the family next door (two adults and two kids) pretty much screaming and laughing extremely loud. I didn't say anything the first morning, but the 2nd morning I ended up yelling back at them through the wall to shut up. I honestly could hear every single word of their conversation. My friends also shared a wall with a utility closet, so in the middle of the night they kept waking up to clinking and clanking noises coming from it.

Anyway, the hotel did not ruin my experience at the wedding at least - I had an absolute wonderful time celebrating, and if I was ever back in Philly maybe I'd go back, I really don't know. again, i don't know Philly well at all, so I can't really compare it to hotels in the area of its kind. But my complaints above would be something to think about.......",0.13632903981264638
Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"I travel a lot for business and in my personal life. Ive been a Hilton Honors member for several years. That being said, I can say that I've had mostly phenomenal experiences at Hilton properties...until now. 
     On arrival, the desk attendant was very curt and unfriendly, not at all offering any additional information regarding breakfast, pool, etc., no smile or any warmth whatsoever. Answered my questions with one word answers. Saw me looking for the elevator, no ""Elevators are over there"" directions. Nothing. I'm not a needy person, trust me, but some common courtesy would is always appreciated. I get up to my room. My room is nice, 2 rooms, nice view. The pool is beautiful and open late, which is nice. These are, unfortunately the only 2 nice things I can say about my stay. 
     After a day of travel, I was hungry, so I went down to the restaurant for dinner and wait to be seated...and wait...and wait... as 4 workers look over at me and continue chatting near the bar. There were only 3 or so tables seated in the restaurant, so it wasn't as if they were hopping busy. Finally, a gentleman comes over and seats me in the corner, puts a menu down and walks away without saying a single word. Ok. I wait...and wait... and wait...TEN minutes go by. Not one person approaches me. Am I invisible? Finally, I book a downtowner ride and leave to go to a restaurant offsite because its been a long day and I'm hungry and could get no service. 
     In the morning I go down to breakfast and am stopped by a gentleman who asks me for my breakfast ticket. I asked""what breakfast ticket?"" He condescendingly says ""Uh the breakfast ticket that looks like THIS"" as he shows me one. I said ""well, THAT is in my room. No one told me I needed it to get breakfast."" He asks ""Are you a paying guest??"" ""Yes, it's in my room."" He then proceeds to tell me he can look me up by my last name, but next time I need to bring my ticket. It wasn't so much WHAT he said, but the tone in which he spoke to me, the guest. Condescending as if I was an idiot for not bringing my breakfast ticket. My husband is joining me on Thursday, there's only 1 ticket, so we will see if the front desk will provide a ticket for him also since no one asked me how many keys of tickets I needed when I checked in. 
     After breakfast I go to get my car out of the valet. Again, a lack of hospitality and another lecture that I HAVE to have the valet ticket to get my car (which i had) even when I provide the valet ticket number, my room number and my last name. 
     To top things off, I have two of my coworkers flying in at different times. One landed at 0830 and came straight to the hospital to work. We left the hospital about 4:30pm and grabbed as bite to eat near the hotel, at which time she receives a phone call from the hotel telling her that her that they were cancelling her reservation because her credit card didn't go through for some reason. She offered a secondary credit card and they would not take her other credit card and allow her to check in when we finished dinner (we were 10 minutes away or she could have checked in online.) Being witness to the entire conversation, the woman on the phone was rude and unsympathetic. She told my coworker she had the right to cancel her reservation and offered nothing when my coworker attempted to resolve the issue. They cancelled her reservation and we had to find her a new hotel for the night and remaining week. My second coworkers flight landed at 6:30pm and she arrived straight to the hotel and was informed that her reservation had also been cancelled, but no one called to notify her. She, in turn, was late, arriving to the hospital for work since she had to locate a new hotel also, not to mention we were planning to ride share our rented vehicle since we would be working different shifts. Now, my coworkers will get the added challenge of cabbing to/from the hospital. All this being said, the Hilton Vision statement reads:  ""To fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality - by delivering exceptional experiences, every hotel, every guest, every time."" While I never understand people's need to be rude or condescending or difficult, I certainly understand that sometimes reservations get cancelled and such, but this is more about how those things are handled. It can be done nicely, apologetically even, while still conveying a difficult message. We spend significant time working in Tampa and we will not be staying here again nor will be recommending this property to others. Had this been my first or only Hilton experience, I'd never stay at a Hilton again, however, being a long term Hilton member, I know this property is an exception to the norm.

So I booked this hotel for 99 dollars plus tax whic I thought it was a steal so I booked for 2 rooms 2 nights. It was our vacation we are friends of Latin African as Indian decent and every year we all get together on vacation. One of our friends was terminally ill so we had to make sure his last vacation was the best. I called and asked how much was the deposit the lady told me it goes by reservation ok I explained the 2 rooms are in my name so she said the deposit will be 100$ on credit card I said ok. So we arrived there around 11:30pm since We all still had to work. Sum of us are aviation mechanics in Med school and ase certified mechanic for Mercedes Benz and we have families so we couldn't just up and leave. Upon arrival the front desk staff demenour just changed. I guess she thought bc of the way I spoke she was speaking to a white girl but no I'm Guyanese. She saw my friends and they were Latin black and an Indian guy. She said give me a sec. Went to the back to speak to a manager which I thought was a bit rude . Anywho she comes back to tell me my deposit per each room is ... Wait for it.... $300 per room. I said what over the phone it was $100. Mind u we already paid to valet our BMWs and Denali gmc . I said whatever and gave her the card. She then said it was $300 per room per credit card. I gues she thought since I'm black I would have jacked up credit so I have her 2 credit cards. So we get to our rooms put our things in our room. We come back key doesn't work. Turns out the key brain went dead we had to wait for the engineer to come in the morning problem wasn't fixed until te afternoon so we had no money to go anywhere. We missed out on going to Busch gardens we prepaid but never redeemed the tickets the  trip was ruined. When we checked out no apology no credit back nothing.

Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,1.0,"This is the worst Starwood Property I have ever been to. Before moving to Philly, I stayed here on two occasions. In both cases the rooms were NOISY. The staff is not helpful and seems a bit on the obtuse side. 

On my last and final stay, I complained to the bellman that the closet door was not on the rails of the closet. He said he would send somebody up to fix the situation. I waited a while but I had to meditate before heading out to dinner with my boss. So, I put up the ""Do Not Disturb Sign"" on my door. The maintenance guy totally ignored the sign and knocked on the door. Then when i did not respond. he had the front desk call me. Total genius.

Then that night there was fire alarm on the loading dock. It was a false alarm and it doesn't sound like there was smoke to go with that fire. I sat out there, with like a hundred of my best friends, for what seemed an eternity, before getting back in my room.

Even if there is no fire alarm the place is noisy. On my first stay, I was off the lobby. The noise bounces into your room from all the people milling about on a marble floor. If your room is closer to the Delaware River, be prepared to hear the highway. I love the roar of a harley at 2am. Zowie!

JW Marriott Indianapolis,Indianapolis,2.0,"My mom and I stayed at this hotel for a conference and the hotel was lovely. HOWEVER, the restaurant service from both restaurants was absolutely despicable.

To start, my mom who has been a vegetarian for 11 years asked our server if something had meat in it and she reassured her it was a vegetarian meal. As my mom was eating her meal she realized she was EATING MEAT.

Me, who has been severely allergic to gluten my entire life, ordered a pasta and meatball dish that they said they substituted the gluten free ingredients for. Just to find out after my meal that their meatballs did not use gluten free breadcrumbs!

They refunded us for the meal.

Next meal, I try the other restaurant. The server was talking about her boyfriend ""daddy"" coming in and asked the hosts not to seat her open table IN FRONT OF GUESTS HELLO? On top of that, I got a chicken Caesar salad with a piece of RAW CHICKEN. They refunded us for my meal but I still had to pay for the new one.

Almost all staff (not including the front desk receptionists) were on their phones consistently.

I work in a hotel and in the restaurant in the hotel so I can be judgmental. However, this was all unacceptable and I don't have to explain the seriousness of the lack of knowledge of menus and quality of service.

Grand Hyatt Tampa Bay,Tampa,3.0,"Pretty place & room, lovely grounds on the edge of Tampa bay, beautiful boardwalks, fantastic sunsets, & club level amenities that were truly impressive. Some members of the staff (particularly the club level staff & kitchen manager, as well as the security guard - let's call him Security Guard #1 - who hailed from Gwinnett County & walked all the way out the gazebo to check on my safety on an evening when my husband was delayed for dinner & I had strolled out onto the boardwalk alone) were extremely nice & did a good job making us feel welcome and well taken care of.

Why not 5 stars, then, you might ask? Because there were a couple of issues that I can't ignore and that simply will not allow a higher rating. 

First, the level of concern in response to some of the problems we encountered just wasn't, well, quite up to par.  On a positive note, let me point out that there WERE individuals over the course of our 3 day stay who did exhibit concern: the front desk staff addressed room problems at check-in with expeditious (if multiple) room changes (first non-conforming room not as reserved, second non-conforming room so noisy even Jesus could not have tolerated the ruckus, final room as reserved, sans racket), and one evening manager sat us at the bar & had us order ourselves a drink on the house while she checked on the status of an item lost by hotel porters during all the room changes.  Overall, though, it was incumbent on us to find people who would pursue solutions & to follow up with them - callbacks by the hotel staff were rare.  Additionally, the lost item issue was never resolved, there was never any contact by management, no offer to compensate the loss, and no indication or assurance that the search would be ongoing.  The staff just were not very responsive on this issue and seemed resigned about the whole matter, as if it didn't really matter much at all.  While it's true that the item lost was not hugely valuable (around $150), it DID matter to us.

To make matters worse, on our last night at the hotel, we had dinner at the on-site restaurant Oystercatchers.  We had a couple of glasses of wine with several really good dishes, which I'll detail more in my review of the restaurant.  After dinner, around 9:30, the very nice waitress heard our plan to walk out on the adjacent dock & sit in the chairs to watch the evening wildlife.  She thoughtfully brought us 2 beach towels to dry off the chairs.  Around 9:40 or so, we made our way onto the dock.  At about 9:45, we were brusquely approached by a security guard - appropriately dubbed SG#2 - who was very different than SG#1 from the night before.  SG#2 was rude and demanding when he asked us to remove a towel we had used to dim a dock light, and despite our immediate and unquestioning attempts to comply with his requests he began to treat us like delinquent teenagers, continuing to harass us even as we were complying, questioning us about whether we were drinking, and telling us he would ALLOW us to stay on the dock for another 10 minutes until it closed at 10 PM, as long as we were not drinking. HUH??  We were stunned. I don't know where the hotel found this guy, but they really should consider returning him to wherever it was.  Judging by his demeanor and his treatment of us, we think maybe he was formerly a bouncer at a bar and wasn't able to switch gears.  Either way, I can honestly say that's the first time I was ever harassed or treated badly at an upscale hotel.  My husband pointed out to SG#2 that we had complied with his request and he asked SG #2 to desist harassing us and leave, which he eventually did, only to return a few minutes later, promptly at 10PM, with a female manager in tow to tell us (again) that the dock closed at 10PM.  REALLY?? We assured them both that we heard what he said about the 10PM closing and, contrary to his belief otherwise, FULLY intended to leave the area given that he had turned a very pleasant evening into a VERY UNPLEASANT one.  

In summary, SG#2's performance ALONE was SO terrible and SO offensive that he could have easily earned Grand Hyatt a one-star Yelp rating, but that wouldn't be fair and wouldn't reflect our appreciation of those staff members mentioned above who did their individual best to make our stay a good one.  Hopefully, the hotel will read this and address the issues so that future guests (which may or may not include us despite the fact that we frequent the area for my husband's business) won't have their stay tainted by similar episodes.",0.19921445221445216
Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"I had the worst experience here.

I paid over $1,000 for 3 night stay during the bar exam. For the price, I expected a lot better service:

- My room was covered in glitter and Vaseline upon my arrival. Seriously. I had to ask for new blankets, remote, and counters to be wiped down.
- Microwave was broken.
- I pre-ordered room service for lunch in between testing sessions. It arrived cold and late. Didn't get to eat lunch.
- One night we tried to go out to dinner but couldn't because the valet driver had taken our keys with him!!! Valet is mandatory by the way and $25 per day.
- The hotel was under-staffed, making the workers grumpy and absentee. 
- When I tried to talk to the manager about the valet issue, she was rude and snarky (then offered me a $20 discount... wow). 
- The staff makes a lot of noise at night/early morning socializing.

The breakfast was good though!!",-0.14142021173271174

From the attentive front desk staff to the friendly server at Trolleys to the pleasant housekeepers, they made a work weekend feel almost like it wasn't.  We were vendors at the Tampa Bay Comic Con and the skybridge made it an easy transition back and forth.

Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,4.0,"We had a really nice stay. The hotel is located in a very quiet area of Old City but is in pretty close proximity to important spots in the city. Check-in was a breeze. The lobby is very nice & has a Starbucks. 

Our room & bathroom appeared clean. We really hated the heavy comforter, we removed it to sleep with just the heavy sheets instead. One of the valets whistled outside of our room off & on from the hours of 3-5am or so. Of course we found it to be super obnoxious & disrespectful but we didn't bother complaining either. Another negative was the lack of mini fridge. Checked out by just dropping our room key in the key box on our way out of the lobby.",0.082

Took over an hour each to check in and out. Room furniture was in poor condition. Bugs found in bed. Lobby is open to the entire hotel and is clearly a free for all until all hours of the night. When called at 11pm and again at 1am, hotel staff said they have no noise policy and told us to deal with it. Hardly the anticipated response from a self designated, falsely advertised,  family friendly hotel. Employees ignored the do not disturb sign on door and entered our room with my wife in the bathroom and my baby sleeping in the living room.

JW Marriott Indianapolis,Indianapolis,1.0,"This is the first time I've stayed at a Marriott and been disappointed.  We came to Indianapolis to take our 5 and 7 year old to the Children's Museum (which was awesome).  We chose to stay here because it was the closest Marriott and we always choose them if possible.

I realized this is a convention facility, but when I think conventions, I guess it typically think of businesses or at least adults.  However, there is a cheerleading convention here right now.

My girls were really excited about swimming in the pool.  They are both still learning and hotels and vacations are really their only opportunity.  I assumed the pool would be crowded given the multitude of cheerleaders.  However (a) this was the smallest pool I think I've seen at a hotel and (b) kids are running amok in there and no one cares.

The whole time we were there, which was not long, about 15-20 kids ranging in ages from probably 7-13 were running full speed, doing cannonballs, and probably worst of all doing what I guess you would call basket tosses and other types of tosses where they spin/throw the girls around the pool off their shoulders.  Several times they almost landed on my two small children and us.  The rest of the time they landed so close to us it was like a tidal wave to the face.  Then they would run full speed between the hot tub (which is supposed to be off limits to kids) and the pool screaming bloody murder about the temperature change and soaking our stuff in the process.



I tried talking to one of the ""cheer moms"" but she ignored me and encouraged the kids to continue so she could videotape them.

This is not the hotel's fault.  Where I fault them is for (a) not giving the parents clear expectations about acceptable behavior (b) not monitoring the pool when they have a convention full of children and (c) not doing anything about it when they saw it with their own eyes.

I didn't even bother trying to call the hotel from the pool because an employee was in there at least 3 times and all he did was make sure the cheer people had enough towels and completely ignored their behavior.  I did call when I got back to the room but the lady that took my call seemed pretty disinterested and just said she'd notify security.  At this point our evening is already ruined and because some of the cheer moms were making snotty and hostile comments because we didn't want their children landing on us, I really don't even feel comfortable heading down to the lobby to try to go get dinner.",0.06177248677248677
Crowne Plaza Hotel Philadelphia Downtown,Philadelphia,3.0,"I'm a Marriott Platinum Member so I'm a little biased. The hotel lobby needs some work, its not very inviting. I wasn't greeted right away, I would think a hotel like this would have a door guy or valet guy and more people working the front desk. I travel to a lot of big cities and I just didn't get the same type of welcoming that I see everywhere else, unless maybe that's just a Marriott standard?! 

I did like the location, it was right across the street from where I had to go for my meeting.  The guy that checked me in was very nice and friendly and was also very nice about having a late check out the next day. 

The concierge didn't really have any great restaurant recommendations and no menu book!  Most hotels in cities have copies of menus of the surrounding restaurants. I walked around for awhile before finally asking a local where I should eat, she directed me to The Dandelion Pub which was great! The restaurant in the hotel had bad reviews so I ventured out. 

The bed was very comfortable but I had a connector door and the guy next to me was talking very loudly on the phone til very late, definitely ask for no connector door. I was also very annoyed when I woke up to a loud noise at 4 in the morning...it was the person putting the receipt under the door, I have never woke up to this before. I think the person hit the door while shoving the receipt under and then the paper hit the wall and more noise! Shhhh people are sleeping!

The rooms need more plugs!  There weren't any by the bed so I had to plug my phone (which I use for my alarm) in across the room.  Being a big fan of the snooze button I found this annoying.  They had a lamp with one plug on it but it was on the desk again far from the bed!   

No wifi in the rooms.  I thought their website said they had wifi in the rooms but only the lobby has it.  I want to check email from my bed!",0.15121753246753247
Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,2.0,"We stayed at this hotel for the New Year's Eve celebration and had a room with a beautiful view of the Ben Franklin Bridge and the fireworks display.  It was a wonderful show and my family and I were going to sleep when we began to smell someone lighting up a marijuana joint.   We called security and they sent someone up.  It was determined that the smell was possibly coming from the vents.  They said they'd check around.  They said they could not determine where it was coming from.   The smell then got worse and it was coming from the door that was adjoining the two rooms.  We called security again.  He then entered the room and also determined that the smell was coming from the next door room.   He knocked on the door and identified himself as security but no one would open the door.  They told us technically if they don't want to answer the door they don't have to.   Really?  This is a no smoking hotel and our room is full of smoke but you're going to allow it because they don't want to answer the door?   They said all they could do was charge them a cleaning fee.   Eventually the party subsided but why should others have to suffer because you have a policy and rules that you can't enforce?   We're not prudes and we're not against partying but when you're traveling with family (including children) the last thing you want to have to deal with is marijuana wafting into your room while you're trying to sleep.  

Management did eventually do a service recovery and that is why I did not give them a totally low score but there's no way other hotels would have allowed that to happen.   This is the second time that I've booked this hotel but if this is the attitude of this chain and management I will consider other options the next time I visit the City of Brotherly Love.",0.14037433155080214
Tampa Airport Marriott,Tampa,1.0,"Marriott is usually a solid and reliable hotel. Unfortunately the management at this location is disrespectful and not at all concerned with loyalty to Marriott Resort owners, card holders and frequent hotel guests. Granted they're attached to the airport which probably brings in a crowd who lay out in the hotel lobby, but when I arrived planning to stay the night it was not a pleasant experience. I was not greeted by a gentleman, instead i I was gestured to sit up and not relax as it did look like I was merely a traveler passing through. I did not even stay the night and went straight to a Hilton, where I am staying currently. This 'manager' did not possess the knowledge that I was the owner of four Marriott Resort weeks and a current active Marriott credit card user. He did not know I was planning to stay the night. Instead of saying 'please sir', he gestured to me as if I were an animal. I did not get his name, but you can guarantee, when he sees this review, he'll regret upsetting an active Marriott member.

No hello, no nothing, and then while she's on the computer doing her thing she is still chatting it up w the other girl about this place. One thing about a hotel is that you MUST have good customer service and those women did not have it. We felt ignored and like we didn't matter.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"If I could rate negative stars, I certainly would. We arrived and the gentlemen at the front gate to the parking garage were great.  We parked and made our way to the front desk, which became a nightmare.  Due to the heavy flow of customers, an African American woman with a head wrap comes out and starts our check in process.  She gets our last name and asked for a major credit card.  My husband informed her the room is booked under a corporate card and we were informed there would be no charges per his employer.  This woman not only begins to become rude and speak to us in a very demeaning manner, but becomes dismissive and answers a telephone call.  My husband then calls his business manager who wanted to speak with this individual, who identified herself as the manager on duty, and she was reluctant and kept repeating we do not take credit card over the phone.  My husband handed his phone to her and she spoke with the business manager. The manager then hands the phone back to my husband, reports ""she is being rude"" and awaits payment.  We were dismissed, not given any regard to our concern, and basically told pay and leave me alone because all I care about is collecting money from you.  We had our confirmation and everything was in order according to my husband's business manager, but the hotel manager did not care one single bit.  This experience has provided us with enough insight to never stay at a Hilton again.  I have gotten better service at economy hotels than here.  I would say please run to a local competitor and avoid this hotel and the aggressive, dismissive, rude, money hungered management.

Tampa Airport Marriott,Tampa,2.0,"The lobby was spacious, professional, a little on the classy side, and the piped in music (snarl) was somewhat muted.  Lighting was a little dim but maybe its my eyes and not chintzy Home Depot LED or CFL bulbs. I had charging port envy-- since the number was really not adequate. Cords able to be strewn distances notwithstanding, get some more ports. I took LIJ he liberty of examining the power to the area, and the columns where TV were mounted could easily be retrofitted with four 4-gang outlets, one on each side of the squatter columns. Do your guests a mitzvah and make some of them USB ports please. While your at it, some floor outlets would be awesome. 

Complimentary coffee in the morning was nice, but not so hospitable when they were removed it late morning.....just when I need a pick me up. 

The concierge lounge was a little on the small side, for a property of this type and gravitas. It was clean, well kept, professional. The person that works there is nice enough but her lack of sensitivity for those who come there to do work was, well, unwelcome.  This was her lounge and she made that abundantly clear.

Her humming, singing, very loud handling of items was a huge turnoff and my business calls were sullied by the cacophony of noise pollution created by this well intended and pleasantly indifferent person. 

In some countries the singing, humming and pots-and-pans clang  is a jail-able, if not unforgivable offense. 

My incessant head turn and semi-scowl semi-smile only resulted in a mirthful laugh and the vacuum cleaner being wheeled out and a 45 minute act-out.....while i was the only person there and trying to conduct a business call.  

Listen, I do not want to be nit-picky; and she was nice and conscientious, but if someone is there trying to get work done, maybe asking them if its ok to start banging the pots and pans, crooning, or vacuuming?  As a note to readers, I asked her if it might be preferable for me to work elsewhere so she could get through her work on her lounge-- and she was very kind and said, of course not.

We have always had a great time never a problem with Holiday Inn Express in fact we prefer it, that being said this was not one of those times. First I went in and ask the lady at the front desk if we for sure had a connecting room and she rudely said didn't I talk to yesterday and I replied Yes you did and she said rudely"" didn't I say yesterday you had one"".. OK I was taken back by that she could of said ""Yes ma'am you do have connecting rooms"" but not with the attitude.. I know she did tell me the day before but , I was just checking . Then we went up to our rooms and our room 403 was not only dirty but smelled like mold and a musty smell too . I guess I should of called downstairs and complained but, we just got in the room late and I did not want to move everyone around. I have cleaned vacation homes , condos and if we ever let our rooms look like this we would of been fired. The person who cleans wiped all mirrors counters walls etc with probably a dirty rag because the rag marks were all over everything streaks etc . The window sills had dirt and cob web in them and the lamps probably never been dusted.. It was just gross . That was not the worse part we smelled mold and musty smell in the room it was so damp in there we were sneezing and felt sick the next morning. Our air conditioner was messed up it worked and then it didn't . Upon checking out we discussed this with the lady(same lady from the day before ) who worked the front and she said we should of called last night.. She is right but, this room has been like this before it didn't happen over night and they know it ! and is there no inspections on these rooms from housekeeping before someone goes into the room ? and if there is they don't care. We also found spots of blood on the chair that I forgot to tell the lady at the desk , we do have pics of that .The whole hotel was gross the elevator was disgusting who ever wiped it down especially the stainless steel never went over what they sprayed on it so it was dripping the oil that was sprayed.The wood was probably wiped down with the rag that was used on all rooms from dirty water.. I do have pics if the hotel contacts me I will be glad to send them over to you . I am a IHG member and honestly this is the worst hotel we have ever been too.

Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing,Indianapolis,2.0,"I visited this weekend from Chicago for a family member's baby shower and didn't have the best experience.  

Pros: (agree with some others) close to highway, nice shower with great pressure, nice bar downstairs, many comfortable couches and chairs to sit on it the various lobbies.

Cons: The bed (it was the pullout bed in the suite) was really uncomfortable, the operator staff was really rude, extremely noisy hotel.  I called the operator because the front staff (who were very nice) sent us to the wrong room.  The woman on the phone was so rude to me and acted as if I should know where I was going in the hotel (and I know there are at least 3 different elevator banks taking you to different parts of the huge hotel).  

Later in the night, we heard music so loud that we couldn't sleep.  I called and unfortunately got the same operator.  She said the music was from Champps across the street (and we were on the 10th floor- it sounded like it was right above us) and she acted as though I should know that!  ""Well, of course, the music is coming from Champps and you're on that side of the building.""  She had a ""What do you want ME to do about it?"" attitude which really didn't help the situation.

Holiday Inn,New Orleans,1.0,"****Pictures of my insect bites can be found in the Photo Section*****

This Hotel experience was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. Every facet of our stay was totally sub-standard and completely inexcusable. Here is a laundry list of the things that went wrong: We called to confirm double beds on the way, and were told that they couldn't do anything over the phone. Then we were put in a King suite with a foldout bed. I slept in said foldout bed, and woke up with bug bites all over the left side of my body. The manager said they would call an exterminator to determine if there were bugs, basically calling me a liar. Then they switched us to a room across the building. We could see into our old room and saw that housekeeping had flipped the couch on its side and were obviously cleaning it before the exterminator got there. The entire time, the complimentary internet access was spotty and unreliable. 

We called the front desk, and received no answer several times. Then, for shampoo, they transferred us to a non-english speaking housekeeper who said they would bring it, even though he didn't know our room number. We ordered room service and were transferred four times. Then we were assured it would take no more than 20 minutes. It arrived cold, an hour later, and the order was wrong. 

There are only 3 elevators which take forever. Late at night you have to wait in line to get back to your room. The plug in the bathtub didn't work. We called the front desk to ask for a cab, and were told there was one coming. Then when we got down there, the front desk person was rude to us, and said that we obviously hadn't talked to her, and that she wouldn't call us a cab. Lastly, the tray from our room service stayed outside our door for about 12 hours.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,1.0,"I travel a lot for business and in my personal life. Ive been a Hilton Honors member for several years. That being said, I can say that I've had mostly phenomenal experiences at Hilton properties...until now. 
     On arrival, the desk attendant was very curt and unfriendly, not at all offering any additional information regarding breakfast, pool, etc., no smile or any warmth whatsoever. Answered my questions with one word answers. Saw me looking for the elevator, no ""Elevators are over there"" directions. Nothing. I'm not a needy person, trust me, but some common courtesy would is always appreciated. I get up to my room. My room is nice, 2 rooms, nice view. The pool is beautiful and open late, which is nice. These are, unfortunately, the only 2 nice things I can say about this stay.
     After a day of travel, I was hungry, so I went down to the restaurant for dinner and wait to be seated...and wait...and wait... as 4 workers look over at me and continue chatting near the bar. There were only 3 or so tables seated in the restaurant, so it wasn't as if they were hopping busy. Finally, a gentleman comes over and seats me in the corner, puts a menu down and walks away without saying a single word. Ok. I wait...and wait... and wait...TEN minutes go by. Not one person approaches me. Am I invisible? Finally, I book a downtowner ride and leave to go to a restaurant offsite because its been a long day and I'm hungry and could get no service. 
     In the morning I go down to breakfast and am stopped by a gentleman who asks me for my breakfast ticket. I asked""what breakfast ticket?"" He condescendingly says ""Uh the breakfast ticket that looks like THIS"" as he shows me one. I said ""well, THAT is in my room. No one told me I needed it to get breakfast."" He asks ""Are you a paying guest??"" ""Yes, it's in my room."" He then proceeds to tell me he can look me up by my last name, but next time I need to bring my ticket. It wasn't so much WHAT he said, but the tone in which he spoke to me, the guest. Condescending as if I was an idiot for not bringing my breakfast ticket. My husband is joining me on Thursday, there's only 1 ticket, so we will see if the front desk will provide a ticket for him also since no one asked me how many keys of tickets I needed when I checked in. 
     After breakfast I go to get my car out of the valet. Again, a lack of hospitality and another lecture that I HAVE to have the valet ticket to get my car (which i had) even when I provide the valet ticket number, my room number and my last name. 
     To top things off, I have two of my coworkers flying in at different times. One landed at 0830 and came straight to the hospital to work. We left the hospital about 4:30pm and grabbed as bite to eat near the hotel, at which time she receives a phone call from the hotel telling her that her that they were cancelling her reservation because her credit card didn't go through for some reason. She offered a secondary credit card and they would not take her other credit card and allow her to check in when we finished dinner (we were 10 minutes away or she could have checked in online.) Being witness to the entire conversation, the woman on the phone was rude and unsympathetic. She told my coworker she had the right to cancel her reservation and offered nothing when my coworker attempted to resolve the issue. They cancelled her reservation and we had to find her a new hotel for the night and remaining week. My second coworkers flight landed at 6:30pm and she arrived straight to the hotel and was informed that her reservation had also been cancelled, but no one called to notify her. She, in turn, was late, arriving to the hospital for work since she had to locate a new hotel also, not to mention we were planning to ride share our rented vehicle since we would be working different shifts. Now, my coworkers will get the added challenge of cabbing to/from the hospital. All this being said, the Hilton Vision statement reads:  ""To fill the earth with the light and warmth of hospitality - by delivering exceptional experiences, every hotel, every guest, every time."" While I never understand people's need to be rude or condescending or difficult, I certainly understand that sometimes reservations get cancelled and such, but this is more about how those things are handled.

The line was super long when I left out for lunch so I stopped by upon returning and asked for the Manager and it was the same rude Aja...she was assisting another customer that had an issue and was just a condescending and rude.  While waiting to speak to Aja, my husband went to the room and sent me pictures of the bed not being made up and the extra blanket/comforter thrown on the bed and a picture of housekeeping leaving only 1 towel.  I gave her a brief description of my issued and told her if she is not willing to help to please give me her Managers name and she gave me Mikes name without any assistance.

I went down to the front desk and there was no one there. I noticed that there was someone in the office so I went there to get their attention. I was rudely told to get out. Then since there was no engineers the best next thing was to hand me some towels and have a security guard to come with a plunger when that wasn't even the problem. The security guard never came. Then I was woken up to a fire alarm at around 12 am. Next morning I had to go back down and remind them my toilet was broken.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Downtown Convention Center,Tampa,2.0,"Very average hotel at luxury prices. The hotel is pretty to look at but offers nothing to justify its price. 

Rooms: very plain and in the span of 3 days had to call the front desk to fix something or another 4 time!! When I checked in the toilet had been used and not flushed, the A/C wasn't working, the WiFi was so weak I had to use my data plan, and I didn't get the extra towels I requested days before arriving. 

Staff: the only reason this hotel got 2 stars from me! The front desk ladies were incredible!! Friendly, helpful, and always available. The rest of the staff wasn't ""bad"" but the kitchen/wait staff spoke almost no English and understood less of it. Asking for simple things like salt, salsa, water, etc was a chore not worth the effort. The bartender during ""happy hour"" was outright rude and clearly was upset to be working. Room cleaning were nice but took forever to get to the room, then did a half ass job once they got there.

Food/Drinks: Don't waste your time on the happy hour! The bartender will tell you it's ""crap"" liquor and all watered down. Seriously, he said that!! ""What do you expect for free?"" Literally his words!!! The buffet was ok. Bland food but plenty of it. The omelette was better then just ok.

View/area: in the right room you get a nice view but you're going to pay for that room. Expect to pay a lot for food at any surrounding restaurant.

One older gentleman who works at the main door really needs some training regarding talking about customers to his co-workers while those customers are in ear shot!  My room had an ice machine right outside the door, so guess what I heard all night?  Who knew people need buckets upon buckets of ice at 230 a.m.??  Now I do. I never could get my digital key, which would have been helpful when my actual keys to my room were bad and had to go back down to the desk to get new ones. I stopped at the front counter and asked if I could get more coffee and cups for my room. The girl at the counter said she would send them right up. Needless to say, I never did receive them. It was also not uncommon while I was getting ready in the morning to hear housekeeping opening my door. What happened to knocking first?  Did I mention I'm a Hilton rewards member?  With being a rewards member, you are supposed to get complimentary WiFi. Which I did.  However, I would loose connection about ever 3 minutes and have to reconnect.

Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing,Indianapolis,1.0,"The Rooms themselves:

The hotel itself is very nice and conveniently located next to Fashion Mall. There's a walkway bridge that connects to it. The beds were decent and there's an excellent pool and gym area. However, no matter how nice the room and the location is-- it's all wasted if you cannot get a good nights sleep while you're there. The walls here are so incredibly thin that we couldn't sleep all night. There was children running up and down the hall way all night and the parents were yelling at them. Our neighbors woke up around 4:30 am and started loudly screaming at one another. Then on the other side a baby started crying. 

Our room had a mini fridge, tv, and complimentary Starbucks Pike Place to brew. 

The Staff: 

I'm not sure if maybe they don't get paid well or if it was just a bad day but these are some of the rudest hotel guests I have ever encountered. I called them up to ask about the wifi (it was acting like it was going to charge us. I didn't get the question out of my mouth before she was hastily telling me that it was free. So then I wanted to make sure the coffee was free too (because room service was over $5 for a cup of coffee) and she was short with me on that too. So I thanked her and she just hung up the phone. Not exactly the type of interaction you would expect for a Sheraton. 

This was our first stay at a Sheraton but I feel like we stayed at an expensive motel with a mall beside of it.

Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,2.0,"I had a wedding brunch at the Sheraton in Society Hill and I was pretty disappointed by it. 

First, I felt unwelcome when walking into the lobby as nobody held the door for me or even welcomed me. 

Also, while the lobby itself was fairly nice. It had some cool seating areas, a cafe and a touchscreen, which showed the many attractions in Philadelphia including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and the Philadelphia Zoo. However, the different rooms, which held many events including the wedding brunch I was going to were not clearly labeled and I had to ask for help to get there. 

The brunch itself was also a bit disappointing. The food was not very great in variety as they only had some basic items including eggs, bacon, pastries and bagels along with some types of juices. I really expect more of a variety of better quality from a Hotel. For example, something like an omelette bar or a variety of unique pastries would be much better.

While I was pretty disappointed in the food options offered, I did think that the staff working here was very nice. 

Altogether, while I found the food to be disappointing, the staff was professional and there were some interesting spots in the hotel including the lobby.",0.12905448717948717

1) it's location and 2) we had a good experience last time/continental breakfast

I have to say this time around however I was disappointed. The front desk didn't have our reservation accurate (we were staying two nights, but they insisted it was just one and made a fuss about it) we talked with four different front desk people during our stay and they were all rude and seemed like they just didn't want to be there.

The room itself was ok, a couple things in our room were broken (lights, switches) the Kleenex box was empty and they didn't give us any shampoo or conditioner just three body lotions. 
As for the overnight stay - it was very loud. It felt like they booked everyone that stayed in the hotel on one floor to make it easier for the cleaning staff or something because you could constantly hear people talking/coming and going/the tv's and people's conversations in the rooms next to us were at times overbearing.

I felt horrible/embarrassed and tried to apologize to Tim. He immediately told me it was not my fault and to not apologize. He made sure we were taken care of and made us feel like we were VIP guests when we were only staying one night. Even the next day he sent someone up to get our bags for us. I truly have not had such an amazing encounter with a hotel manager. He is one of a kind! Furthermore ALL the staff we encountered were amazing and helpful. I was offered bottled water upon check-in because they said the wait was a little longer due to a computer issue. However, I only waited about 5 minutes. I later received a phone call in the room apologizing again about the wait and offering me a credit at the restaurant for the next morning to make up for it! Oh and did I mention the staff gave my sons a gift wrapped DVD from under the hotel's Christmas tree? I was also upgraded to a harbor view room which was breathtaking watching the sunset over the water. The room was clean and super comfy.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,1.0,"ISO RELAXATION AND MY STAY WAS EVERYTHING BUT THAT 
Where do I begin? Well I guess from the moment I got to the hotel since that's when it all started.
My sons spring break was this week and I planned a trip to Tampa, Fl for a relaxing mini vacation. I booked with the embassy because it is a higher tier Hilton hotel and the previous embassy hotels I have stayed at always exceeded any expectations/standards. Upon my arrival, I asked to be put on the highest floor available with a view. I was informed that it was possible and they would take care of me during my stay. (Well they definitely didn't) When I checked in I asked the front desk where the best fine dining in downtown Tampa. Her response was all chain related such as Bahama breeze, magianos, and chipotle. Okay well then, no big deal. We go to check out the room and we're on the 8th floor which is halfway up the hotel. Not the highest floor...Get this... not only did they not put us on a high floor they put us on the construction floor where all the rooms surrounding us were being renovated. WHAT? Oh just wait because there's a kicker to that. Also.... no view of the bay. IF I WAS ON A HIGHER FLOOR I WOULDVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE IT. Well they have reception hours every with snacks and 2 drinks per guest. As soon as we get up to the reception area the alarms start going off having everyone evacuate the building. Well that went on for 30 minutes and I was told there a maintenance issue with the hotel. So nerve wrecking and scary for me and my family. The alarm went off again shortly after for a brief period this time. While we were getting ready for dinner I asked for more towels and an extra cover to be delivered to my door and left. Hilton hotels have these no contact policies where they minimize the number of elevator guest, enforce masks, and of course delivery to the room NO CONTACT. I went to take a shower and got out to give my son a bath and was told someone knocked/called the phone. I go okay finally it's here, just to go check and see there's no towels/blankets. I call the front desk and was answered with a rude tone of voice informing me they tried calling many times and knocked on the door. (He was real aggressive with his tone of voice) I mentioned that I asked for them to be no contact delivery just like the rest of the Hilton hotels are doing. He mentions that this location DOESNT do that because they don't want to have any issues with stealing. STEALING? TOWELS? A SHEET? (Because he didn't bring me a blanket) LOL what? I'm at an embassy and you justify my comment with the thought of someone stealing something as simple as that? It's a health regulation that makes me feel safe. If I know someone is coming to my door and knocks... who is going to steal it in that time frame? I mean maybe, but  aren't there cameras in the hallways? ANYWAYS...
I was told it was going to be a while before they were able to bring it up because they didn't have time to waste OR I could come and get it. At this point, my son is in the bath WAITING FOR A TOWEL. I can't leave him in the room alone!? I had no choice BUT TO WAIT. So 35 minutes go by and we finally get our belongings. Still didn't enforce no contact. 
It really was just as if one inconveniencing thing after the other would happen.
So that night I set the thermostat to 73 heat and it was on 67 cold when I woke up. It was interrupting my sleep all night having me toss and turn. I cannot speak for everyone but I can't sleep in the cold. They were manually changing it from the front desk or it automatically resets, either way it was VERY DISRUPTIVE. We were told the pool was open, but when we go over to see it the next morning it was construction site with nails, tools, and just not feasible for me to bring my child over to the pool. That pool shouldn't be accessible. Such a safety hazard! The next morning was check-out and a Monday. I woke up at 6:30 and toss/turned until 8:30 because of the CONSTRUCTION GOING ON in the rooms on our floor. Ting ting ting, drilling noises, and loud thuds in the early morning isn't what you want to wake up to when you're on vacation, especially the morning you have to travel home. I just wanted to sleep in and have some peace and quiet. I mentioned to the front desk my want to speak with the hotel manager about all of these inconveniences. She reached out to the manager.  He was busy in a conference call but to take my number and name and he's be sure to get back to me. LOL. It's been over 24 hours and I still haven't heard anything. I truly do not feel valued as a gold member/team member with Hilton. Very upsetting experience.

Small things like the exhaust fan in the bathroom and some lights were not working. A minor annoyance but I was okay with this. Second, today after returning back to my room exhausted, I notice that the room was not cleaned at all. No clean towels, no bed made, nothing. I went downstairs to ask the receptionist if they clean the rooms daily and she said yes. I thought maybe because of the room change they didn't know this room was occupied. Before I can even ask the receptionist if the room can be clean as soon as possible, another woman who works there interrupted and told us that ""The rooms will be cleaned soon"" very aggressive and frankly rude.

Philadelphia Marriott Old City,Philadelphia,2.0,"This wasn't the worst hotel I've ever stayed in, but it definitely didn't even compare to the best.

I'll say that the renovations were nice... and that's about all this place has going for it.  My biggest problem were the amenities in this hotel (or lack thereof).  I assume this Sheraton chooses to charge all of its guests for every little thing because of their location, but it's a really big pain.  Let's break it down.

Pros:
+ Nice, remodeled rooms
+ Fitness center with high-end equipment (though small)
+ Nice pool 
+ Free USA Today available Monday-Friday
+ In-Room Starbucks Coffee 
+ Small Starbucks in lobby (expensive, though)

Cons:
- Base rate is $189+ tax (and rooms aren't big)
- Nice pool full of annoying kids from 6 a.m. - 10 p.m.
- Paid WiFi ($9.95/day) - I'm sorry, but why is WiFi free at Days Inn but it's not here?  There are other Sheraton's in the city of Philadelphia that have FREE WIFI... but you don't?  Unbelievable and highly, highly irritating.  Your patrons appreciate free WiFi, trust me.
- Slow, slow service.  When requesting more coffee (there was only enough for one person), it took two or three phone calls to actually get someone to come upstairs.  Coffee (and other toiletries and things) were never refilled during cleaning service in the morning.  What's the point of the coffee, then?  
- Rude front desk service.  When WiFi was free for the first two days we were there and then paid after, I called to complain.  What is the deal with that?  How is there just not free WiFi?  The front desk attendant didn't care about anything that I had to say and was actually rude about customer suggestions.  She told me there was nothing their hotel would do about these situations and there was no one else I could speak with to discuss the matter.  I know she was lying, but her rudeness made me want to get off the phone immediately.
- Super expensive in-house restaurant.  Standard breakfast was $13.  Oatmeal was $9.  Yogurt + bagel was $10.  Dinner entrees were $20+ and the food was pretty mediocre.  You're better off walking one block north on 2nd Street and going to any one of dozens of restaurants in the area.
- Lack of amenities for conference goers.  Most other hotels/resorts offer free WiFi to conferences that use the facilities and we got nothing.  No free coffee service in the morning, no free WiFi, no places to sit/stand to do work... nothing.  I've been to other conferences in other hotels and they definitely offer their guests much, much more in terms of amenities.

Don't come here.  The rooms are way too expensive for their lack of 20th century remodeling and amenities.  I'd say stay anywhere else (like the Hyatt down the block) if you want to stay somewhere large.  This hotel is not worth your time or your money.",0.006131277647671085

When it became our turn for checking in the attendant turned into a vastly different girl! No chatting  it up with us. Requested ID, never said please or thank you when handed to her. ""Form of payment"" no please or thank you. Decided to inquire about these extras that were discussed wIth the guests before us.  ""What's the Sullivans thing?"" The attendant  said ""oh"" as she handed us a coupon card dated 2018 that looked like it had been in someone's wallet  prior. We then asked about the parking we heard the nice guy beside her mention. We were then told it's only free if you paid online (which we did) or were part of a group. Tone was short an dismissive.  We then ventured to our room. Posts on here  with complaints of noisy groups of kids are true. Lots of sport team kids here. We decided to contact the hotel manager about our treatment Josh. We relayed our experience to him. While he listed, the majority of the response included excuses such as ""I know her"" ""I worked with her this morning"" ""I've never gotten complaints on her before"" instead of taking this as a customer service coaching  opportunity and validating that we were made to feel unwelcome. Our room was average. Clean but decor seems dated and water stained ceilings were not a good look. Morning breakfast buffet proved no better. The $15 buffet presented withh cold food! Our server RaShana was kind enough to try to make it right for us. Very sweet. The manager's effort on this was to microwave our plates. So no seconds at the buffet.

Sheraton Indianapolis Hotel at Keystone Crossing,Indianapolis,3.0,"Not great, not horrible, but most likely won't return.

PROS:
- Attached to the Keystone Fashion Mall 
- Breakfast buffet staff is fantastic
- Fast room service
- Good WiFi

CONS:
- Rude front desk staff. We checked in and the front desk lady snapped at us several times. I understand working during the holidays is not ideal, but wow. As someone who worked in hospitality, I would have been fired on the spot. I know staffing can be an issue right now but wow, truly bottom of the barrel.
- Valet was hit or miss. Often times the post was unmanned, and if valet was full, we were told to ""park it ourselves"" in the garage. Why would we pay to park it in the garage if we already paid for the valet parking?
- Shower takes 35 minutes to heat up. Our room, and my MIL's room was the same. When we called down to the front desk, the only solution was ""wait a bit longer"". Really? Glad we were showering at night and didn't have anywhere to be in a hurry!
- Our bathroom retained a weird ""water park"" smell for the duration of our stay. No solution for that either. 
- This property is overpriced for what it offers. It is in desperate need of a revamp to continue to compete with its neighbors. Our ""leather"" desk chair was rubbed down to the bone, rips in the couch, just really old and run-down looking. It is in poor condition.

This property and staff are not going out of their way for any additional cleaning measures, only about 20% are wearing masks, common areas extremely dirty, rooms dusty, if you are looking for a hotel that takes the pandemic seriously, this isn't it.",-0.021852764094143412

"The Logan Philadelphia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Philadelphia,1.0,"I had high expectations for my 2-night stay, and was very disappointed. 

First, the bathtub in my room was not draining properly, so by the end of my shower I was standing in a foot of water. 

Second, the door lock broke so none of my room keys worked. My room was a long walk from the elevator (the very end of a very long hallway), so I spent a solid half hour walking back and forth from my room to reception trying to get a key that would work. That was my only half hour of downtime for the day (I was here on business), and I never did get into my room before I had to head out for my next obligation. 

Third, when I got back to the hotel later that evening, I finally made it inside my room only to discover that housekeeping had never come by. The tub was full of grime because the water took hours to drain from my shower, the bed wasn't made, no new towels, etc. I had NOT left anything on the door saying they should skip my room, so I am at a loss for why they didn't tidy. Especially since that morning, I had heard housekeeping going room-to-room at a rudely early hour (7:45 a.m.!)

Other than that, the room service food was quite bland and disappointing (and comes to your room packaged in to-go containers rather than plated service), and the accomodations themselves were fairly middle of the road.

She said we got a letter,  there was signs posted and it was on our key card about the water.  Uhh. No.. We did not see/get any of those warnings.  She lied. Seriously we double checked our key cards nothing,  letter.. Huh? What letter.  And signs.. There was a sign posted but it said the elevators would be working slow bc the up button only worked,  you could ride them but you always went up to collected passengers before heading down.  But not a thing about water.  I should've taken a picture of our key card and the elevator sign. Why weren't we informed upon check in in person? Dewana was the front desk lady's name and she kept telling us like we should have known. She said its been out for two days the morning we called.  But it had worked the evening before so she was all wrong.  We said we needed to know when it would be back on so we could make a decision about staying there or moving hotels.  We have small children so jumping hotels is not the easiest thing.  We figured if it was on soon we'd stay.  She said she was going to call us back in 5 minutes and never did.  Someone sent a dirty looking plumber engineer guy to our room. He promised we'd have hot water by that evening.  He said 12 hours.  So we took that and went about our day looking forward to showers and baths that evening.  But no. It didn't work at that time.  So we called back the front desk.  Talked to a manager who said she had no idea why he told us that. We called the 800 embassy number and they helped us get 75% of our money back on our stay.  The hotel was still checking in people as we were checking out and I didn't hear them tell them either. Someone even said it was sold out this weekend.  Our room was never cleaned the entire time either but she did come by while we were there and dropped off fresh towels.  (ha.. Bc we couldn't shower. So no towels needed)..

New Orleans Marriott,New Orleans,4.0,"Right off the bat, I must admit I was a little too hard on the Nola Marriott. First impressions are important, and they kind of blew it, but my experience with the hotel (in the flesh) was so much better than I thought it would be. 

I arrived on a Tuesday afternoon and met with John L. for check-in. He was very professional and nice and, above all, sincere. My experience with him changed my entire view of the hotel - I really hope they see this and he gets kudos. He was the absolute best. 

Next, the elevators. I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about! Honestly, the elevator system is genius and I can see why they implemented such a system. I was there in the off season and it got busy, I can only imagine what it's like when Nola is actually busy. What's so hard about entering your floor number and waiting for the system to tell you which elevator car to go to? Nothing. It was so great - I sang the system's praises to every staff member I encountered. 

The food provided at my conference was meh. Breakfast with only coffee, bagels and weird biscuit things with meat/eggs/cheese baked in the middle? I wondered where the fresh fruit was, then someone told me fresh fruit is hard to come by in Nola. I'm not sure if this is true, perhaps it was just an oversight on my conference organizers' part. Anyway, breakfast was decent, but very heavy. Lunch was what one attendee described as ""wedding food"" which I thought was kind of rude, but also fitting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I'm not complaining. 

Overall, I enjoyed my stay. My room was clean, no one bothered me (I kept the ""do not disturb"" sign on the door for the duration of my stay), and the staff was super friendly.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,2.0,"Just as all the other reviews have stated: the views were great, the room was clean, and the concierge was considerate. The hassle came with the 23 dollar  ""resort charge"" for items and exclusives that we did not even use. When the nice man at the checkout desk ran our debit card, he did not mention this wonderful extra charge. In fact, he even went so far as to show us our total (which did not include this charge) on his cute little calculator. So as you can imagine, we were surprised when we checked our account, that we had been charged this money.

When we went to talk to the front desk in the morning concerning these charges, the concierge was quite nice. He tried to be sympathetic and told us a story about how Hilton screwed him over with ""small print charges"" on a recent vacation he had taken. Uh...that's well and good, but that doesn't help us get our money back. When he went to get the manager, we expected a courteous, understanding, respectful professional, but unfortunately, we received Defense-o: The Mega Grump. 

First off, she did not even look at me: the adorable wife. She introduced herself to my husband, shaking his hand. It was extremely weird.  When we explained our debacle, she instantly became defensive. She asked, ""Sir, have you ever even STAYED at a resort before?"" Although I was able to keep myself from thwaping her in the throat, if you look very closely at the counter, my frustrated finger nail scratches remain today. The only thing that was missing was her snapping her fingers several times in front of herself. When we mentioned that we did not see the small print associated with the charge on the website she said, ""Well, sir...don't you read contracts that are put in front of you?"" Remember, she was saying these things in the most condescending tone you could ever imagine. When we brought up that the guy at the checkout counter never mentioned the charge when he gave us the list of ""resort exclusives"", she actually interrupted me and said, ""I can guarantee my agent did not do that."" Really? Can you? Because if he had, we would probably not be there, arguing over a stupid charge with a woman who had about as much customer service savvy as an old, offensive sock. 

Now, we are reasonable people, yes. If this manager had only said, ""Hey, I'm really sorry for this misunderstanding, it happens a lot, but it is a standard charge yatta yatta"" it would have calmed us a bit and we could have moved on with our lives. But no. This manager (I shudder even saying the word, as such word would indicate a certain level of customer service) decided to make us seem like poor, irritating scum from the bottom of the social classes. 

And that, my friends, is why we will never stay at that hotel again; because of one defensive, rude, little manager. If this is the level of professionalism that Hilton expects from its managers, I weep for their future. I so hope she learns to keep her rude comments to herself, be apologetic, and try to calmly explain Hilton's policies rather than making the guests feel like idiots.

I offered to pay for the hotel and we would stay together in one room. I had difficulty finding a hotel close to the convention center since most were booked up. I found a vacancy on an on line hotel booking site for the nights we needed and at the Embassy Suites in NOLA on Julia street. It was located very conveniently a few blocks from the convention center.  After seeing the vacancies available, I called the hotel directly and they told me they were booked up and to take the on line vacancies if I found them. I did book the room on line and booked it for 3 adults. ( the price was not a reduced price but was the same price offered by the convention offerings).  I booked the room for 3 adults but when I received the confirmation, it stated in fine print that the room is only guaranteed for 2 adults per room so I called the hotel back and was told it would be a 2 bed room or a room with a bed and fold out couch and we would be ok. I added an additional night to the reservation later directly through the hotel and confirmed again the reservation was for 3 adults. My daughter arrived to the convention a day before my husband and I arrived. She was given a room with a double bed only.  It was so small, that she didnt even have room to put an additional cot. It was not the normal suite which I have always found at Embassy Suites. She went back downstairs to report the problem. She called me on the phone from the front desk and was almost in tears. The front desk clerk told her that there was nothing he would do since it was booked on line and not directly from the hotel. My daughter asked me to talk to the clerk to explain what I was told when the reservations were made but he refused to even talk to me. She put me on speaker phone so he would hear what I had to say but he wouldnt respond. After she continued to try to talk to the clerk, he told her he would get her a two bed room but was very rude to her. He also would only give her tickets to the breakfast for two people not three per day. The room was very small and had two full size beds with no suite as advertised.  The bathroom was so small, there was about 6 inches between the door and commode. The room appeared to have not been used in a while. The dust on the bedside table was so thick, I could write my name in it. The hall light did not work. The carpet was unclean and had black sticky spots on several places. The commode was leaking water and would continuously turn itself on to fill up the tank and was very loud. (waking us up at night numerous times) The tub was draining very slow and would fill with dirty water while taking a shower. When my husband and I arrived, I reported the problems in the room to the housekeeper by leaving a note and a tip on the bed. These things were not addressed while we were there. I again reported them when I checked out.  I also tried to get the additional breakfast tickets for three people each day instead of two. I was told there would be an additional charge of $12 for each breakfast ticket. After I discussed with clerk the details of our booking the room, she handed me a ticket and frowned at me. RUDE!!!! 
As for the breakfast, I was dissappointed with that as well. They were so busy that the tables were not being cleaned off and we could not find any place to sit. I could not find a place to place the dirty dishes  to clean a table for myself.  Many of the tables were being used to just place dirty dishes on so customers could clear their own tables. The food was ok but not the usual quality breakfast that I am use to having at an Embassy Suite. On check out, we called to make a request for a late check out for 1pm to coincide with our flight schedule.  The normal check out is at noon. We were granted our request graciously. When we tried to use our room key at 12:05pm it would not work. We went downstairs to get our key recoded and had to wait in a long line. After having it coded again, went back upstairs and it still did not work. I talked to a housekeeper who was close by and she stated ""do not speak English"".  We were stuck out of our room for almost a half hour while trying to get it fixed. This caused us to be rushed to get to the airport and check out. 

On a positive note, some of the employees were great and not all were rude as mentioned. I did enjoy the breakfast greeter who took your ticket and handed you a tray. She was always smiling and very cheerful which was nice in the morning. The location was great for the convention and had some wonderful restaurants within close walking distance.",0.06708276966089467
New Orleans Marriott,New Orleans,1.0,"Treated like crap. Plain and simple.

After driving 14 hours from Miami, the extremely rude front desk clerk informs me that my reservation has been mysteriously canceled. I understand stuff happens, but she refused to do anything about AT ALL because I booked the reservation through Priceline. Helping me find a different hotel would have been nice, but I would have even been satisfied with an apology or some sympathy. None. Then none from her manager either. They were literally just going to leave me stranded, even though, since I never canceled the reservation and Priceline had it as a good reservation in their system, it was clearly Marriott's fault. Priceline was able to get me into the Sheraton across the street for the same price, and that hotel was very nice and the staff was lovely.

Kudos, however, to the Marriott valet, who allowed me to leave my car there even after the switch, and the extremely helpful Marriott bellhop who volunteered to wheel our luggage across the street for us to the new hotel. The front desk staff could learn something from their fellow employees.",0.14856737012987012

Hilton Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,1.0,"WORST HOTEL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.

Two of my girlfriends and I stayed here in the summer of 2011. I booked on Hotels.com and the reviews there weren't bad. We wanted to stay in the city but this hotel offered a better price with a short drive to the places we wanted to visit. When we arrived we were pleased with our room; it was spacious and clean looking. There was a big bed for two of us, and a couch for one more. I think the couch was a pullout, but being on the short side, I was able to sleep on it without opening it. It was pretty comfortable. The bed was extremely comfortable.

Despite the comfort, we did not get any sleep at all. There were several rooms rented out by kids. Many of them did not even seem to be 18 years old. They were making extremely loud noise in the hallways and in their rooms all night long. The room next door to us had the double joining doors, I could hear right through them. We called the front desk to complain. The noise continued. After a half hour, I tried calling the front desk again but the power was out, including the phones. I went to the front desk and the woman behind the counter was EXTREMELY helpful. She was apologetic, understanding and kind. She told one of the security guards about the issue and said that if they keep up the noise, they will have to leave the hotel. When my friend and I went back to our room, the halls were quiet because most of the kids went out to smoke. However, my friend being frustrated started telling one of the lingering kids that they need to keep quiet, and it's late at night, etc. We went to our room. When the kids came back, a different security guard came up and said he didn't hear any noise when he came up but walked by and saw us making commotion with the kid across the hall. We are in our late 20's. Why on earth would we be starting a fight with a bunch of teenagers?! He was completely rude to us and told us there was no noise. When the kids came back from smoking, the security guard wouldn't come help us. He was also rude to the concierge. I think he was either racist or sexist because the concierge was a woman; she and my friend and I are all not white.

If you want to skip everything I wrote, read this: Horrible experience with staff. Also, my friend found a bed bug upon returning home. Luckily she found it and killed it before it infested her life. Don't stay at Hilton Philadelphia Airport. HORRIBLE.",-0.0164174972314507
Embassy Suites by Hilton New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"Stayed here for two days with my husband for a mini-vacation since having our baby. Negatives: somehow we kept seeing little fruit flies in our room. Not sure where they came from, but they kept appearing out of no where. The front desk staff was not very friendly. When I walked up to check in, I was ignored by one guy and then irritably greeted by the girl. Welcoming, right? Not only did they not have any suites (which we were told we would get one if we arrived around noon), but we were also placed on a floor that was having renovations. Next door to us. At 8 in the morning. 
Not everything was bad though. Positives: The balcony view was gorgeous. Sangria at happy hour was very good. When we ordered room service, the waiter was really nice, very friendly and personable. Also the valet attendants were very nice, we barely had to wait for the car.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,2.0,"Came for Sunday brunch with family, two of whom were guests at the hotel.

The manager studiously ignored us, instead spending her time pointing at tables the busboys needed to bus, as if they couldn't see for themselves. When
we finally flagged her down she offered a 20% discount. Only later, after the other table had walked out, did she decide to comp the 8 non buffet meals.

AC Hotel by Marriott New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"My rating is based on the oh.........30 minutes I was there. After seeing my room and the hotel's indifference about the issues I checked out and went to the JW. I'm a regular Marriott visitor so I wanted to try the signature series, which was a mistake.

Location is ok, not great. The hotel is recently renovated but falls under more of a boutique hotel due to the layout. My issue is that I reserved a higher class room than the basic and was given one adjacent to one of the elevators and on the meeting room floor. The noise was unbearable. I asked the front desk about options and they gave me keys to another room, which turned out to be a lower class of room (even smaller) and she didn't say anything about that. Even though I'm an elite member there was no effort to change or upgrade my room and instead I cancelled the reservation and got a cab.

Cons
* No storage space in room. The drawer is smaller than a desk drawer and the exposed hanging area had enough room for about 4 garments. Not enough room for a couple that were staying 5 days.
* Rooms - Not what I expected from a signature series, very small. Renovation is ok but lacked amenities. It is a low hotel (7 floors I think) and I was given floor 3 despite my reservation request and profile for a high room. So you're going to get a lot of street noise.
* Staff - I wouldn't call them rude (out front and desk) but they weren't friendly

Pros
* None",0.05447368421052632

Mind you it was well before 11:00  a.m. When asking to speak with the manager more attitude was giving and there was not a manager on duty to converse with us. We proceeded to check out the scenery of the cityand continuously called the hotel to inquire of any updates as we became exhausted with little to no sleep and beginning to run out of things to do. Everytime the front desk (same) lady asked for our party's name she nastily stated the same no rooms or manager available. The 3 of us proceeded to make our way back to the hotel walking in to the same front desk clerk about to give another guest a room. Oh yeah, this was around almost 3:00 pm at this time.

All in all once we were finally able to speak with the ""GM"" he was just as rude and nasty as the front desk.

We were charged $80 per person for a sunset trail ride. When we arrived as instructed at 4pm there  was only one woman there , she had her retainer out on the table, was eating pizza, and had a pack of cigarettes next to her food, and the staff for the ride wasn't even there yet. We waited almost 20 minutes.
The smell was overwhelming. The horses were filthy, to be honest. They were caked with dirt and feces and their manes were matted. 
Our ride started at 4:40 and ended at 5:15. The sun was directly overhead and it was no where close to sunset.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"This hotel is located in the Oro Valley just outside northern Tucson AZ.

The grounds are small and beautiful. Strictly a four-star. If you decide to stay there, ask for an east-facing room with view of the Catalina Mtns. Very picturesque. 

I am comparing the El Conquistador to the four-star Desert Springs Resort in Palm Desert which is simply stunning in nearly all categories. I am also comparing it to the amazing five-star Ventana Inn in Big Sur CA, which I have also stayed at recently. 

The problem with the Tucson resort hotels such as the El Conquistador and Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort (on the east side of Tucson) is that you are going to run into the wannabes such as we have had the misfortune of doing. This will also happen in Scottsdale such as at the Scottsdale Resort. You're going to have to either stay at a ""road warrier"" place or at a resort in Paradise Valley such as the Sanctuary.

Recent example at the El Conquistador: we stayed there over the Thanksgiving 2009 weekend and although many of the guests are polite and considerate, the wannabes (aka ""$30k millionaires"") are also out in force there acting loudly arrogant, inconsiderate, and resorting to bully tactics on very short notice. I'm not sure how they can afford to stay at a four-star, but apparently they do. 

In our case, we had to use the Business Center computers (2) there because we had to conduct several transactions online using a secure server. This included banking transactions and other transactions involving use of our cc number. To use our laptop (we bring it with us) would not have been advisable since wireless keystrokes can be picked up by anyone in the vicinity, thus risking hackers.

Anyway, 2 very rude and inconsiderate women looking like Dollar Store shoppers showed up about 4 minutes after we entered the Business Center, and stood directly behind me - which to a reasonable person, would put them in plain view of my screen since the screens there do not have a privacy shield. 

I turned around in my seat and politely let them know we had just arrived and would need time to be able to finish up. The younger of the two rudely commented that ""we're going to stay here"" or words to that effect, as though she was concerned about keeping her place in line where no one else was waiting to come in. As though this hotel is the sort of place one would need to worry about that! 

An older couple entered in about 10 mins later, and were rudely told by this young woman (late-twenties) that they were ""still waiting since these people were supposed to be gone by now."" The older couple did the upper-class thing and left, stating they would return later.

Which if these two females had done, we would have been out of there by then since we would not have had to delay performing our necessary tasks having to wait for them to leave, since politely informing them of our situation did no good. 

This situation is the 2nd bad experience I have had at this hotel. 

The first was earlier in Spring 2009 where a couple in the room next to us began fighting verbally which devolved into a series of physical attacks upon each other. 

I guess other guests called the concierge to alert them since I received a call from the concierge inquiring about noise or other disturbance I may be hearing. (Are you shocked? There's more....)

I let the concierge know that I was hearing sounds of a physical fight going on in the room next door and I was embarrassed to state this since I have never encountered anything like this in a hotel or anywhere else.

Anyway, she notified hotel security and two officers came up to the room in question, and conducted a room search. I could even hear them opening the drapes all the way and going out on the balcony to search for additional participants. 

The fighting couple left a couple of hours later or were asked to leave, not sure which, but they left.

So, I have had two bad experiences with this place and will not be returning.

Loew's Ventana Canyon (not to be confused with the Ventana Inn in Big Sur) is worse since they feature ""Girls Night Out"" events which encourages the wannabes to stay there. 

This is what the wannabes do: gang together in small groups and split the cost of a room four ways in order to afford it. They then party loudly all night long and goof off in the pool area. Their low-budget conduct is derived from the TV show ""Sex and the City"" which is the Mother Ship of behavior standards for the wannabes.

The five stars such as the Arizona Biltmore do not participate in this sort of thing. Neither does Canyon Ranch in Tucson. These resorts/spas are fully aware of the wannabes and know what to do to keep them out.

I'm sorry, but I cannot rec this place to anyone seeking a resort experience.",-0.024205182072829123

New Orleans Marriott,New Orleans,1.0,"""Hey Lisa, how was your last trip to New Orleans?"" 
""OMG! Let me tell you about the racist hotel bartender!""

This is how the description of our vacation begins. We are frequent visitors to New Orleans and while we usually stay with friend,  we do like to occasionally try out hotels. The hotel itself was nice and in a great location. The front desk staff were friendly and helpful thus our stay started out fantastic. On the second day we decided to have a cocktail in the hotel bar and that is where we met (I am choosing to not release his name here for the time being) the bartender. He started up an unsolicited conversation with us and out of nowhere he said things that I could not believe would come out of someone's mouth. This is just a sample- ""In New Orleans we are used to the blacks.""; ""After Katrina the Asians took over""; ""You know that they speak American, they just choose to speak Mexican.""; ""I go to the post office and all the signs are in Mexican""; ""The Constitution was written in American, the Declaration was written in American, and the Bible was written in American."" We had to listen to this for 10 minutes while we were trying to pay to get away. He asked where we were going and we lied to just get away from him. The rest of our stay there we avoided the bar, which is hard with it being in the middle of the hotel, because we did not want to encounter this man. We informed the manager the next day, but were not sure that action would be taken.
I called to report the incident to Marriot headquarters and when I was finally able to speak with someone it was not a positive experience. When the woman on the phone looked up our reservation she stated, ""Oh, you made the reservation through Priceline."" I knew then that our complaint would be ignored because to Marriot we did not have ""brand loyalty"".  I also sent an email and when I received a response I related the incident and guess what, Priceline was brought up again. I was promised a follow up in 5 days. One month later and nothing. I wanted action to be taken and that is why I made a formal complaint and not a bad review. Well, since it seems like public shaming is the only way to receive a follow up.
I not only frequent the city regularly, we have many close friends in NOLA who have made the decision to boycott the  hotel and I know that one person has already influenced a conference to not use the hotel.

Cockroach in my co-worker's toilet, wasp in mine.  Not to mention the moths, ants, and dead flies near every light.  Clearly they don't dust or vacuum often enough.

The beds were clean, but I honestly slept with all the lights on for fear of roaches coming out.  Most of the staff was really rude and incredibly slow (30 minutes to check in and out with no line).  There was a trainee at the front desk who was very nice and helpful, but I forgot her name.

My AC was broken so I called to have it fixed at 6pm, 11pm and 1am.  Although the tech came out to fix it the first two times and was nice, the hotel did not offer to switch me rooms until 1am.

Terrible customer service, terrible conditions. I would never go back - for $300 a night I could have stayed at a much nicer hotel and just driven to the event.  Save yourself the experience.",0.006739130434782612
New Orleans Marriott,New Orleans,2.0,"I haven't even checked in and I've already had a bad experience. This hotel doesn't offer shuttle service, which isn't a problem as their website provides a link to reserve a shuttle through Airport Shuttle New Orleans. The shuttle service's website is fairly user friendly, but unfortunately ""New Orleans Marriott"" isn't an option in their destination drop-down menu. I called the hotel to see if they could tell me which Marriott to select (I can't be the first person to be confused by this). The first time I called, a woman answered the phone. I started talking and, very rudely, she said, ""I can't hear you, we have a bad connection. Call back. I can't hear you, we have a bad connection. Call back."" Her tone was rude, but whatever - I can't get mad at technology failing and sometimes people really hate when there's a bad connection. I called back from a different phone and ended up speaking to the same woman. I explained I would be in town for a conference and I was attempting to book a shuttle through the shuttle service's website, but couldn't find an option for ""New Orleans Marriott"". She then interrupted me and told me ""we don't have a shuttle."" I told her I was aware of this, as this information is posted on their website, and that I was attempting to book a shuttle through Airport Shuttle New Orleans. She then said, ""you have to go through Airport Shuttle's website."" I explained that I was on the website, and restated my initial question: ""do you know what name your hotel is listed under on the shuttle service's website? I'm not seeing New Orleans Marriott."" She then replied, ""Oh. It's Marriott New Orleans."" 

I understand this is trivial, but throughout the call she was rude, interrupted me and didn't even listen to me. I know my question was somewhat stupid - if I had just gone further in the reservation process on the shuttle service's website, I would have seen ""Marriott New Orleans"" matched the address at 555 Canal Street. I figured the hotel staff, who I am sure have had this question before, would know best. At the very least I expected the person answering the phone to be friendly. Maybe hospitality standards are different in New Orleans? I guess I'll find out when I'm there next week.",-0.055633971291866036
"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"This hotel is located in the Oro Valley just outside northern Tucson AZ.

The grounds are small and beautiful. Strictly a four-star. If you decide to stay, ask for an east-facing room with a view of the Catalina Mtns. 

The problem with hotels such as the El Conquistador and Loew's Ventana Canyon Resort is that you are going to run into the ""wannabes"" such as we have had the misfortune of doing. This will also happen in places such as Scottsdale like the Scottsdale Resort. You're going to have to either stay at a ""road warrier"" hotel or at a resort in Paradise Valley.

Recent example at the El Conquistador: we stayed there over the Thanksgiving 2009 weekend and although many of the guests are polite and considerate, the wannabes (aka ""$30k millionaires"") are also out in force acting loudly arrogant, inconsiderate, and resorting to bully tactics on very short notice. I'm not sure how they can afford to stay at a four-star, but apparently they do.

In our case, we had to use the Business Center computers (2) there because we had to conduct several transactions online using a secure server. This included banking transactions and other transactions involving use of our cc number. To use our laptop (we bring it with us) would not have been advisable since wireless keystrokes can be picked up by anyone in the vicinity, thus risking hackers. Note: there is a $10.00 fee for wireless connection in  your room - not a problem unless you need to use passcodes or cc numbers.

Anyway, 2 very rude and inconsiderate women looking like Dollar Store shoppers showed up about 4 minutes after we entered the Business Center, and stood directly behind me - which to a reasonable person, would put them in plain view of my screen since the screens there do not have a privacy shield.

I turned around in my seat and politely let them know we had just arrived and would need time to be able to finish up. 

The younger of the two rudely commented that ""we're going to stay here"" or words to that effect, as though she was concerned about keeping her place in line where no one else was waiting. 

I got the distinct impression that she was angry that they found us there first.

Her behavior was out of place and digitally ignorant of a user's need for cyber privacy. 

An older couple entered in about 10 mins later, and were rudely told by one woman (late-twenties) that they were ""still waiting since these people were supposed to be gone by now."" The older couple did the upper-class thing and left, stating they would return later.

Which if these two females had done, we would have been out of there by then since we would not have had to delay performing our necessary tasks having to wait for them to leave, since politely informing them of our situation did no good.

This situation is the 2nd & last bad experience I have had at this hotel. 

The first was earlier in Spring 2009 where a couple in the room next to us began fighting verbally which devolved into a series of physical attacks upon each other.

I guess other guests called the front desk since I received a call from staff inquiring about noise or other disturbance I may be hearing. (Are you shocked? There's more....)

I let the staffperson know that I was hearing sounds of a physical fight going on in the room next door and I was embarrassed to state this since I have never encountered anything like this in a hotel or anywhere else.

Anyway, she notified hotel security and two officers came up to the room in question, and conducted a room search. I could even hear them opening the drapes all the way and going out on the balcony to search for additional participants.

The fighting couple left a couple of hours later or were asked to leave, not sure which, but they left.

So, I have had two bad experiences at this place and will not be returning.

Loew's Ventana Canyon (not to be confused with the Ventana Inn in Big Sur) is worse since they feature ""Girls Night Out"" events which encourages the wannabes to stay there.

This is what the wannabes do: gang together in small groups and split the cost of a room four ways in order to afford it. They then party loudly all night long and goof off in the pool area. Their low-rent conduct is derived from the TV shows ""Sex and the City,""  ""Dallas Divas & Daughters"" and ""Real Housewives of Wherever"" which are the Mother Ships of behavior standards for the wannabes.

The five stars such as the Arizona Biltmore do not participate in this sort of thing. Neither does Canyon Ranch in Tucson. These resorts/spas are fully aware of the wannabes and know what to do to keep them out.

I'm sorry, but I cannot rec this place to anyone seeking a pleasant resort experience.",-0.031158493248045465

"The Logan Philadelphia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Philadelphia,1.0,"I stayed at this hotel many times over the years when it was the Four Seasons.  I always had a nice experience. Things have certainly changed. The renovation is ok. The place is still pretty tired.  The staff is friendly.  The room service is bizarre in that they hand it to you in a paper bag with your food in plastic tubs with plastic untensils.   This is certainly not the norm for an upscale hotel.  That is not what has me so upset. The hotel has abused my credit card from the moment I arrived.   We came here for two nights for a wedding.  I am hosting my children and ourselves for a total of 5 rooms.  The room rates were $259, yet they charged through almost $850 on my credit card per room right after I checked in.   I inquired at the front desk and was told that they charge an extra $125 / per room / per day in case there are damages or in case we skip out on a food bill.    This is absolutely outrageous.   I am 58 years old and here with my family. We are not here to damage the place or run out on restaurant charges. When I gave them my credit card to swipe, I was covering any incidental charges. They also charged my daughter upon check in for a room that I already paid for.  I have gone back and forth with the manager who assured me the charges would be straightened out.  That was more than 24 hrs ago. The charges are still on our account. . I just checked my credit card account.  They have billed me almost $5,000 so far.  $259 per night x 5 rooms x 2 nights = $2,590.  If I use an overly generous guess on all the taxes and fees, it shouldn't be over $3,000   These people are scam artists. They abused the trust I placed in them when I gave them my credit card.

Parking is ok. If an event is being hosted, expect to park in an obscure location. 

Facilities are dated - but valiantly maintained. However, the low ceilings due to drop ceiling tiles and chipping / peeling paint is failing.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,2.0,"We stayed at El Conquistador for the Tucson Marathon and the staff was rude, the room smelled and is in need of a renovation and parking was ridiculous.  For the $199 room rate plus they charge a ""resort fee"" on top of that (how can we take part in resort activities if we came for a marathon??? just paid $14.95 for 2 cheap bottles of water) this hotel does not cut it.  They had a Christmas party so all those guests took up hotel parking. We parked out back, I mean waaaaaay out back in the dirt. Then hiked in and it was freezing. Cutting through the hotel would have made our trip to the front desk shorter but without a key we had to walk all the way around. 30 minutes later with bags in hand and very dusty, we were not only hungry but pretty cranky. We were not greeted except the front desk person said ""name?"". Pretty curt. Turns out we needed to go back to our car and one person on staff there (I wish I got his name) was very nice and said he'd drive us back there. He apologized for the parking and was the only person who knew what customer service was. Finally we got to our room and it smelled of smoke and mold.It was one of the bungalows out back.  I called the front desk and was told that was ""impossible"" that it smelled like smoke because it was a non-smoking room. Well ... someone didn't follow the rules. It still stinks. The television remote did not work, the fridge sounded like it was ready for take off, the room was in need of paint. and something sticky was on the floor around the toilet so we had to wear shoes in the bathroom, that is until the first time we flushed it and it backed up....Almost 10:30pm and we needed to get up early for the race, I was not happy. I called and a very nasty operator told me the front desk was busy and they'd call me. 30 min later, no call. I called back and she was even nastier. Finally I was told there was one other room, clear on the other side of the grounds. I couldn't move my car because there was no where to park. I decided to confer with my husband and then decided I'd call back and ask for the manager. There was no manager that ever got on the line, just another front desk person who at first claimed to be a manager until I asked him his title. He finally admitted he was not a manager. He did however find a room that they were ""holding"" for someone and it was close to our room. Given it was so late they probably weren't showing up. ""You think???""  I asked. He sent a bellman over with the new key. He gave me the new key and took my old one and sped ahead of us in his cart. He never thought to ask us if we'd like a ride as we towed our luggage behind. We went in to the room. It didn't stink and the plumbing worked. At first the television didn't but after 10 minutes of warming up it finally came on. Knowing I had to get up very early we decided we'd just stay there. This room too looked pretty run down and definitely in need of a fresh coat of paint but it would do. In the morning when I went to check out, out of habit I said ""Thank you"" and all I got was ""you're welcome"". Wait I thanked them for letting me spend money in there run down hotel with poor service? Seemed a bit backwards. The person at the front desk never managed a smile and certainly couldn't be bothered to say thank you.  Pretty dismal.  I would have rated it a one star but the fabulous meal in the restaurant was the only bright spot in a pretty nasty stay.

Holiday Inn Express Philadelphia-Midtown,Philadelphia,2.0,"Just stayed here overnight on a Saturday as part of a bachelorette party. The hotel is in a super convenient location and the rooms were overall what I would expect from a Holiday Inn Express. 

Now I've stayed at a lot of Holiday Inns. Obviously they are not going to be the highest caliber hotel that you can find. But I must say that the staff at this particular HI was quite possibly the least helpful hotel staff I have ever encountered anywhere. 

First off, it took a solid 25 minutes for the woman working the front desk when we arrived to check us in. She kept noting computer problems (which I can understand) but 25 minutes, really? When we finally were checked in, we were informed that one of the two rooms we had booked was still not ready. Even though check out time is noon and check in is at 3 and we didn't arrive until 3:20 and by the time we checked in, it was close to four. In my humble opinion, there is absolutely no excuse for a room to not be ready an hour after check in. 
The woman working the front desk did apologize (very briefly and only once) for the delay but still, this a hotel, it should've been ready. 

As we were leaving the next day, we were checking out and I asked the woman (different woman from the day before) handling our check out if she could split the room into two different cards. I had a reloadable Visa gift card that I wanted to use on part of the room. The woman rolled her eyes and then took one look at the card and said that she knew the card wouldn't work. I asked her to please at least run the card to try it. She said since it was a gift card, it wouldn't work. (For the record, the beauty of these gift cards is that you can use them anywhere, as if they are a Visa debit/credit card). She grabbed the card from my hand, ran it through and hastily informed me that it didn't go through. She wouldn't even run the card a second time when I asked, she just very rudely shoved the card back and me and snapped that it ""wouldn't work."" I was very taken aback by the whole scenario because I have used the gift card in multiple circumstances and was very displeased that she seemed more interested in proving that she was right over cooperating with me (a paying customer). (Side note, I used the gift card on the automated parking machine outside the hotel not five minutes later and it worked flawlessly.)

New Orleans Marriott,New Orleans,3.0,"Stayed here 3 nights during a work conference. Positives - good location, great selection of food at M lounge (when open) and friendly staff in general. 

Negatives - property is very dated. Rooms are generally small and old. The front desk upgraded us to larger room which was good but bathroom was still tiny and bath tub as well as sink would clog up.  We didn't report because hotel was so full with multiple conventions going at the same time that there was always a long line at front desk. Also the M lounge was supposed to be open 24 hours for water and snacks yet 2 out of the 3 nights it was closed. Front desk was nice and gave us waters but again because it was so full we found ourselves waiting just to get bottled water. 

We had drinks at bar twice. First time was not a good experience as the server was pretty rude and brought us a beer we had decided not to order. She didn't seem thrilled to be working that day so maybe we caught her on a bad day. This was on a Monday afternoon.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"This past weekend my husband and I stayed at this resort as a local resident for our 15th Anniversary.  When we arrived we was greeted by Justine! Started off so so but with each question we asked it turned into a  poor attitude and zero eye contact. The 1st question was about how to add this stay to my honors awards, answer she cant help me with that since my husband reserved online through a 3rd party. Ok fine, next question was being it our Anniversary what could the hotel accommodate us with to help make our stay as little more special. Justine flat out said nothing...that my husband should have booked online through the main site to find this put. Once her mouth kept moving rudely I wanted to turn around and request a refund.  Considering the reason we was there, we decided to stay. Walked to our room which the journey was through and old out dated hallway. Reached our room put the keycard in and it did not work. My husband had to walk all the way back to the front which wasnt close to inform Justine again of this problem. She said the key is fine it mist be the battery in the door, but the keycard all of sudden worked. Maintenance came and said nothing was wrong with the battery but the keycard must have not been activated SMH. We tried to make the best out of our weekend and decided to hit the jacuzzi which we hit the pool area which was loaded with screaming kids which wasnt a bother to us because we have 6 kids and we adore children.  The problem was we decided to head to the adult side in the casitas and slide into this jacuzzi. We was driving by a very nice young lady that drop is off left is and said when you ready just call us.  Well sadly to say by the time she came back with another couple and their lil son we was waiting outside to go back to the main hotel. Why? Because there was a couple in the jacuzzi having sex and did not stop once they saw us nor the other family. The nice young lady wish I got her name but she immediately apologized phoned security asked for her manager and apologized again. What a beginning of the start of a horrible Anniversary. Making the best of it we just joined a few kids splashing water and screaming at the sexless jacuzzi which was ok by now. The next day was check our time. I spoke with a Micheal whom I complained to about what our stay consisted of, Justine's rude behavior inconsiderate skills as the Manager of this Resort. She not once apologized for our incident at the jacuzzi, didnt offer us any additional comps or couldn't hand us a free mint. She had to many no's and alot of unapplied attempts to satisfy us an  customers.  I wouldn't choose this resort again if Justine is standing at the front desk. Oh and breakfast was horrible.

1. I'm right next to the elevator. Typically this doesn't bother me but the walls are paper thin. (I at first kept thinking there was airplanes going over the building..) I called later that night to see if I could be moved and unfortunately all they had was 2 rooms left, both my elevators.

2. Every time this elevator goes up and down next to my room, it makes my internet TV freeze. I've called - engineering was supposed to fix this two days ago......they never showed. Called today and the front desk transferred me to someone that was remote and was 0 help. 

3. The shower. I noticed a hair on my sheet and ignored it thinking that it was mine. Then I go to get into the shower and there's a bar of soap left over from the previous guests. Not the end of the world but curious of their housekeeping now.... AND I get into the shower and it's ICE cold. 

I called and let the front desk know everything! They didn't say much except ""we apologize about that."" Then later on today I asked for a late check out (I check out tomorrow). I'm traveling with a coworker and she had a 2PM check out today because she asked. They tell me that the latest they can do is 12 and 12 is really pushing it.

Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans Convention Center,New Orleans,2.0,"Wow! I can't believe this place has gotten 4 stars...ever. Definitely not a 4 star establishment. They are lucky I am giving them 2. Let me explain...

Location...It is located in an ""alley"". We had a lovely view of what appeared to be an abandoned warehouse. I was actually frightened to walk in this 'hood at night. Never a plus for the hotel you are staying at.

The rooms...I am not a bed connoisseur at all. In fact, give me a piece of plywood and a pillow and I am happy. I wish this hotel had some plywood because it would have been better then their beds. When I laid down there was a large lump in the bed so my feet did not touch the mattress. Nice. Decor was mediocre. It was clean, which is always a plus.

The service...some of the WORST service I have ever encountered at a hotel. Our first impression was terrible. There were 2 men standing at the valet stand shooting' the s*&^ upon arrival. Instead of helping my mom up the stairs with her suitcase they stared at her and muttered ""hello"". Are you kidding me? You acknowledged her presence but couldn't help her up the stairs? Nice. We asked one of those men what we should do while we are in the area, specifically about a ghost tour. His response? ""I dunno...I don't believe in ghosts."" Um ok. I particularly liked the gentleman who stood at the desk and texted instead of greeting guests. Our departure was much the same. Instead of helping me with my suitcases the guys stared at me. Nice. On a positive note (why they are getting a ""free"" star) there were 2 employees that were particularly nice. Both Cullen and Michael (I think that was his name) went out of their way to help us ""plan"" our trip. They made restaurant reservations for us and even offered to come and get us if we got lost. I thought that was nice.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,2.0,"My 2 starts is for the location. Yes... it is beautiful, there is no denying that. That's where it ends. The staff here should be trained by the Marriott hospitality staff because they have a LOT to learn about customer service.

Upon checking, the front desk person was rude and condescending. I asked to upgrade my room and what the cost difference would be, she quoted me a price 100.00 more than what the price of the same room was online. She said she could not 'honor' the online price. LOL - so much for 'Hilton Honors' ha! I stay at Marriotts usually, and this never been told to me. 

The rooms in the main hotel are just ok. I guess they were renovated a few years ago, bu they are still drab. Also- the road behind buildings 1 and 2 where you are to park your car, is very busy! All day and night long cars pass through, non- hotel members, as there is a neighborhood behind the buildings....sounds like you are staying in NYC, that is how noisy it is.  Funny thing is, this rooms cost more because of the 'mountain view.' It's more of a view of the parking lot with sounds of a freeway.

The lounge in the main building is very small and lacks character. Not an inviting space to relax and enjoy the view. 

Overall, I would never stay here again. There are so many other beautiful hotels within a 20 mile radius, all with the same majestic views of the mountains, that are well trained in customer service and have beautiful updated rooms and amenities.",0.19983974358974357

Chey informed me that I was late and would be charged for my check-out. I told him a previous front desk staffer had told me otherwise, and he simply could not have cared less and showed absolutely no interest in helping.

Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans Convention Center,New Orleans,1.0,"Lack of Compassion & Common Sense. 

Many of us understand the challenges many people and business are going through during COVID times. However it seems as it big companies are hiding behind this excuse not only to cut the work force but to blame the lack of compassion, common sense and lack of customer service behind the COVID excuse.  During my recent stay at this property I encounter that for us as ""guest"" booking the rooms in single day increments instead of a entire stay seems like a better idea in  order to receive housekeeping services. We are still paying full rates Covid or not; housekeeping or not. 
The solution however seems easy and simple, if a guest stays longer than 2-3 days offer them fresh towels, guide them for the disposal of garbage from the room, or simply offer them the required amenities for their stay making their booking more comfortable. This was not the case at this property, the manager seemed upset and bother when I requested fresh towels and amenities 3 days into the stay. 

Additionally, people book hotels because their are traveling and it is normal to use the bathrooms after a trip. Reaching the hotel is for many a relief, the end of the trip and the begging of the vacations. For other it's simply a good night rest before work whichever the case might be this would be home-base for the next few days.  However this hotel and many other have decided to close all facilities/bathroom behind the COVID excuse. Last time I went to a hospital they had their bathrooms open for patients and visitors despite the pandemic. Imagine you go in for an X-ray/Lab work but your not allowed to use the bathroom. This seems to be the model at this hotel. Simply because they cut the housekeeping crew and or do not want to deal with it. During this stay I encounter the lack of common sense and compassion at this property as upon my arrival, with a bathroom emergency, the room key had been deactivated. Running down to the lobby for help to be simply ignored because the front desk person cannot do 2 thing at the same time. This is the new COVID model. I don't care about your emergency although I made the error ""it's Covid time"", take it. You have to take it!!! I don't want to hear it!!! This is the new rules imposed by us.

First impression: the hotel decor is on point and well put together. Comfy and stylish seating looked welcoming. Different art pieces (sculptures and paintings) graced the lobby. Check in was smooth and the front desk was helpful. As our first day came to an end, I was pretty happy about my selection. Until it was time to sleep. I woke up at midnight itching. My husband asked me if I was okay and then he noticed his cheek was swollen from a bite. Yup, there were bed bugs. We called the front desk and they immediately sent someone (I think he was from the engineering department?) He was very polite and reassuring. He got to our room and we checked our beds and sure enough, he found two bed bugs. He captured a couple and placed it in a cup for a sample. We went downstairs and spoke to Matt and Paulette in the front desk. We had asked for allergy meds since my husband's face swollen and I have bad allergies to bugs. Matt was kind enough to get Benadryl for us. The front desk staff wasn't rude or mean, but as I spoke to them, they seemed indifferent. You would think that they would go the extra mile to comfort guests who were just bitten in so many areas (face, elbows, feet) they moved us from room 802 to 508. So tip: do NOT stay in 802. Our bellhop (wish I remembered his name) was very nice and chatted with our 7 year old son. He told us to call him if we ever need anything. My husband had a hard time falling back asleep at 1am, paranoid that there would be bed bugs again. As mentioned, the front desk seemed indifferent as if it was OUR fault. As if we wanted to find and get bitten by bedbugs. They didn't offer us a refund or to do our laundry (we were scared that we might take the bed bugs home with us) until we asked. We asked and we received the refund and the laundry was taken care for us. I spoke with Michelle on the phone the next day to ask about sending our laundry and she was kind enough to offer us vouchers to the on site restaurant Urban Farmer after I had asked if they served breakfast. Anyway, the lesson here is, if you need something done at The Logan, you need to ASK because they won't make that initiative to go above and beyond to rectify a bad experience.

"The Logan Philadelphia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Philadelphia,3.0,"3 star hotel. Nicely appointed rooms. Beautiful lounge, garden and outdoor seating area. Convenient La Colombe coffee bar in the lobby.
Here are the issues: we stayed in a suite for the weekend for $700+/night. Impeccable cleanliness is expected at this price point. There were black hairs on the bathroom floor and in the shower. The bidet (which I did not use btw) didn't look impeccably clean. The lighting in the room was dim, especially in the vanity area, and one of the lamps did not work. Housekeeping never came on Saturday.. so ended up making our own bed in the afternoon.
We also had an adjoining room for the weekend which we paid an additional $350+/night. There was furniture blocking the doors to the adjoining rooms, so we had to move chairs and lamps in order to gain access. We spent over $1000/night to move furniture!? This should have been set up prior to check-in. These details are key.

We stayed as part of a room block for our daughter's wedding. There were issues with this too. One was the hotel contact person had an attitude, almost to the point of rudeness, about one last-minute reservation change. In addition to the block of rooms, we rented several pods at the rooftop Assembly lounge. In total our group dropped over $30K for the weekend. At this price point, I expect five star service.

We also watched him run a red like and cut off a car one night while we were on our balcony. Would not recommend this hotel and the pictures of it online are definitely out dated,0.08333333333333333
JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"To start; I travel approx. 110 nights per year between Marriott and Hilton brands.  I have long had a slight preference for Marriott as I do believe their consistency is typically better overall.

For this trip to NO it was a personal trip, in which I booked an upgraded room as I wanted the trip to be more enjoyable, comfortable etc.  Additionally I was traveling with friends so having a larger suite was just easier.  

So let's get into the good.  Suite was wonderful once we finally got into it.  The bell staff, specifically Tim was very attentive + friendly, getting the car in/out of the valet was easy.  Lobby bar is great.

On the flip side..... The other staff at this hotel may be the WORST I have experienced in 20+ years of heavy travel.  Upon arrival, which was fairly early in the day - I received a rather unenthusiastic and annoyed welcome from Brennan.  The room was not ready yet (which at 1030AM I expected), however when I inquired and made request to check in around 3 she was not helpful at all.  At that point we moved on with our day.   

After an enjoyable Saints win vs. the Bucs I returned to the hotel to attempt to check-in, shower and relax for a few after a day of travel & football.  At that point I was dealing with Ashlee, who was absolutely & unequivocally the rudest individual I have ever made an attempt to work with at a hotel property.  She could not answer simple questions, rolled her eyes at me on more than one occasion and could not even carry a conversation allowing me to explore alternatives to my potential stay.  At that point I asked to speak to the manager, Ashlee walked away w/o saying anything to me & returned approx. 7 minutes later with the same answer; your room isn't ready.   

As a mid-higher level ranking status w/Marriott (50+ nights so far in 19') I inquired if I had any benefits to my status.  At that point I was asked to hold on while Ashlee disappeared to the back again for approx. 5 minutes.  Once again returning with little to no satisfaction to my liking.  She could not even get close to answering when the room would be ready.  Mind you I prepaid a large sum the day of booking, had asked Brennan to check in around 3 & Ashlee failed to provide any details; nor did the manager ""Mike"" ever make an appearance or try to help.

The room was finally ready about 615PM that evening.  I received no call, visit from the manager or a simple ""We are sorry for any inconvenience"" or an acknowledgement as to the fact they were extremely late getting our room cleaned and ready.  No one was friendly to me upon our return for check-in.

Room Service:  Ordered simple beverages, took nearly and hour to arrive.  Hit with 22% service charge to bring beverages to the room.  

Check-out:  Had the pleasure of the infamous Brennan at checkout the next day.  Once again, very rude greeting - no eye contact, could not answer virtually any questions I asked.  And no offer to discount or acknowledge the previous days events as being an oversight on their part.

Based on this experience alone, I will not stay at this property upon any trip to NO again.   They are completely incapable of assistance, they are in no hurry to do anything for a paying customer & they certainly have the worst attitude I have ever experienced.  

Wake up JW - YOU ARE IN THE SERVICE BUSINESS!!!!

Pretty much every day was like this - so plan on being charged and not being helped.

Crowne Plaza Tampa Westshore,Tampa,2.0,"Worst stay at a Crown Plaza. 
(It gets more than just 1 star bc the bed and pillows were pretty comfy and the room was pretty clean and modern.)
Rude housekeeping staff, banging on my door telling me to open the door if I want my room cleaned. I said to come back later and she said ok. My room was never serviced. Which isn't a big deal, I had plenty of towels, but the little trash cans were full. The worst part was hearing the housekeeping employee talking about me (not opening the door to her) to another employee down the hall when I went to get on the elevator to leave. I felt very uncomfortable hearing hotel staff complain about me openly for everyone on the floor to hear. 
The rooms do not have a fridge or microwave of any kind. The ceilings are pretty low for a ""Crown Plaza"". 
There was construction going on during my stay. No big deal, except they painted the inside of the elevators during the day, so when I came in that evening- there I am trying not to touch the inside of the elevator while also trying to fit in there with a family and all their luggage. 
There was very little parking near the front entrance. I parked in the back and was surprised the back doors near the meeting rooms were all unlocked at 11:30pm! No key entry- just unlocked doors! Not the safest area for this set up. 
Every Holiday Inn I have ever stayed at is nicer that this Crown Plaza. Most hotels require a key to enter any door that isn't the main lobby entrance. Every Holiday Inn I have stayed at had professional staff which didn't even knock on the door if they could hear you in your room during the housekeeping time. They especially didn't ask me to come open the door so that they could come in! And there is no ""do not disturb"" door hanger or I would have used it!
 I've stayed in the Crown Plaza hotels in Pensacola, Miami, and NYC Time square. This place is a dump compared to those locations! Save your money and stay at a Holiday Inn when in Tampa!
(On the IHG hotel list, a Crown Plaza is supposed to be a level up from a Holiday Inn, but this hotel is at least one level below any Holiday Inn I have stayed in. We are IHG rewards members, so I've stayed in about 30 IHG hotels over the last few years.)",0.018500712250712252

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,5.0,"This was my first trip to New Orleans and I called a few hotels prior to booking. The only reason I decided to stay at the JW was due to the manager named Malcolm. He was informative, friendly, and professional. When my group of four arrived we were greeted and received great initial service. Valet was courteous as well. We stayed for five days and ordered room service twice. Room service was quick depending on the day and time but overall they did a good job. Even when a mix up happened with our order they were quick to fix it. We also spoke to the Director of Loss Prevention, Jadé, and she was so patient and understanding with us. There were a few employees, in suits, who seemed hypervigilant, not in the best way, but they were ignored. I would encourage for all staff to take breaks if the Essence crowd gets overwhelming at the hotel. Again, only two men in suits of concern. There was also a young man who was very helpful at the front desk. I never caught his name but he assisted with late night requests and remained professional at all times. He made several trips using the elevator and I'm sure that can be frustrating but he never let it show. The only thing that disappointed me was being unable to meet Malcolm in person.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"Started our week with the idea we would have a nice relaxing pleasant week in Tucson. Was told upon check in that rooms were only being serviced every four days but they would put us on the 3rd day service. Keep in mind that each night we have to call to the front desk to ask for water, coffee... shampoo etc.. towels.. and also the robes that never were available upon arrival.. .. wait time is at least an hour which can be considerable when you've been out all day and get back to your room ready to shower and relax.. we are now on day 3 and trash is piling up.. no water, no coffee and no fresh towels because housekeeping never showed up.. We were told by the snarky front desk person that she would follow up and find out what happened so it doesn't happen again.. that's fine for the Hilton, but how does that help me? Now her tone starts to move more to the sassy side when she says since I don't like her solution then what do I suggest? Really? Who is in charge of customer service? How about move me to another room? How about a complimentary wine and appetizer at the bar while your staff fixes the problem? Maybe a $100 credit at the spa? Free round of Golf? How about comping the room? Clearly none of these ideas even entered her customer service sphere .... I've stayed in several hotels since COVID and this is by far the worst experience.  There's nothing worse than paying a premium price for a hotel stay..  having dirty towels on the floor.. trash bins full.. no shampoo ( because it's late and still a no show) and a rude front desk person who has no concept, concern or ability to rectify the situation...",0.046
Homewood Suites by Hilton New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Never have I experienced poor customer service.

I contacted the front desk (woman by the name of Ricknie answered) to inquire about receiving a credit card authorization form that I was suppose to receive from a manager (never received) to make payment on an upcoming trip.

Her response was a pause then ""ummm, I'll send one to you"". I questioned whether I would get it now because I wanted to make a payment - she stated yes. TWO HOURS LATER NO FORM.

I contacted Ricknie again. I advised her that I didn't receive it. She huffed and said ""well i was on break but I will do it"". 2 HOURS FOR BREAK???? I said okay.

30 minutes later, no form. I called again and she answered and asked to speak to a manager - she huffed, didn't say anything, then put me into someone's voicemail. VERY RUDE. Customer service 101 - announce your plans to the customer. Obviously I didn't want to speak to a voicemail so I called back again. NOW REMEMBER, I WANT TO MAKE A PAYMENT - SHOULDN'T I GET BETTER CUSTOMER SERVICE THAN THIS???? This time, it took 8 minutes for someone to pick up the phone. This time I got Shane. Pleasant voice. I asked him could he send me the form and he stated he would take my information. He left me on hold for 7 minutes. Ricknie then comes on the line - no hello or anything - LOOK MA'AM, I SENT IT TO YOU. I asked her ""what do i need to do to get this form, i checked my spam and general email and have nothing, can you at least fax me the form?"" She says ""look, you gotta talk to someone else"" then connects me to a voicemail in accounting. ANOTHER VOICEMAIL. I call back and guess what...they pick up the line, no one says anything and hangs up on me. I did this 3 times, same results. I never deserved this kind of treatment for trying to make a payment.

I immediately called corporate and talked to Tanya (very professional) who helped me within 5 minutes. She advised that the systems must be down, but if I can wait a few days she will have it mailed and also contact the hotel and find out contact information who I can send payment too. WHY COULDN'T RICKNIE STATE THIS????

For her to act like this makes me think the Manager of this hotel doesn't care how her staff behaves. I've seen other bad reviews about the front desk and I see nothing has changed.

Very rude staff. I'm waiting on a General Manager to contact me (still waiting after 3 days) about this - this is unacceptable and I don't want another customer to have this experience.

The staff needs to be trained properly on how to talk to customers professionally in any situation.

Embassy Suites by Hilton New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"I have been blessed to travel the world. Eastern Siberia to South America and many places in between.

The manager of this Embassy Suites just treated me as if as a guest I had to bow down to him; as his entire staff was awesome.

Manager Keith found it fitting to go and beat on my door as he felt offended he claimed by how I treated the hotel staff.

He made his true colors be shown in front of 3 employees, Keith a parking attendant, another unknown attendant and the front desk clerk; all of which I had had conversations with. I am a triple
Chaplain and had a prison Ministry and share the love of Jesus Christ to all.

I can get into details if anyone of the other managers wanna call me.  He mandated I get downstairs immediately after beating on my door like a simple minded fool.

I go downstairs and express my grounded argument and he says he doesn't care and I am still welcomed to leave.

I was down there to pay for another night; yet his loss of self control said I could leave.  I am; as I have never struggled to have others take my pay for their services.

The entire staff was awesome; but deceiving advertising. Parking area provided means $44 a night for parking. They only offer valet parking, no self parking in their lot.  Didn't bother me much!

Was initially put in a room that had not been cleaned; 803, where I found trash and a undershirt smeared with feces right on top of the unmade bed.  This after a 15 hour drive. 20 mins later I get another room.  Didn't even complain. Regret not getting a picture but managers can check with the staff.

You should be ashamed Manager Kevin. Basic principles of business totally ignored; huff and puff yourself right out of a job Kevin.  Consider yourself lucky.

Now when your staff sees you; they know the true you, but heck if you treat your guest like that I suppose you treat them worse.

Prayer for this young foolish young man.  Asking my company to never ever use this place or entire chain for any and all my travels.

I help the homeless and those selling their wares; but folks not guest freely walking into their huge entry area to even charge their phones.

I help any and everyone; but this conduct is totally unacceptable. Would you want your wife, mother or daughter staying where such is simply allowed or unaddressed.

Our room number at Embassy Suites New Orleans was 1306.  We were originally set to stay July 23 - July 31, 2019, sadly we checked out today since we can no longer tolerate the filth of the hotel and the horrific customer service.

As you can see in the pictures below, our room is filthy with damaged furniture (not that the furniture matched to begin with).  Our room was not cleaned for three days!  After finally insisting on speaking to a manager, Bryanika sent a housekeeper to our room.  The housekeeper made the bed, replaced the towels, and emptied two of the three trash cans.  We happened to be videoing a game of backgammon and accidentally recorded a random dirty Qtip on the floor next to the trash can.  The maid emptied the trash, returned the can, and walked on past.  She did not replace the sheets, soap, shampoo, glasses, or vacuum.  The attached pictures were taken after she ""cleaned"" our room.

I phone Bryanika again and invited her to visit us in our room.  I will say she was incredibly apologetic and quickly got a housekeeper to properly clean our room, but her excuse that she doesn't speak Spanish and can't instruct her employees doesn't bode well for the success of that department.

In addition to the filth of room 1306 and the continued lack of action from the front desk staff, we have had multiple poor experiences with the valet staff.  They are slow, lazy, and rude.  I have never seen a worse valet service in any Hilton property anywhere in the world.  

We are very well traveled and are brand loyal to Hilton - we are both Diamond and Gold HHonors members.

Be careful giving them your credit card. We booked through a third party and checked out today. We come home and see a $764 charge made the day we checked in. We have NEVER used this card before.

We call the hotel and they have no idea what the charge is or ANY info on us there. They tell us to call third party. We called them and said we already paid everything and shouldn't have been charged anything. 

No we didn't trash the room or break anything. 

We are beyond frustrated at the moment.

Update: We finally called the Marriott hotline and spoke to the elite service department. They were able to call the hotel directly and find out what happened. Apparently the person that took our credit card originally was new and mistakenly charged taxes and incidentals without explaining. The taxes had already been paid so that was a complete mistake. Either way they took care of the issue and I appreciated that but I did not appreciate the runaround.

As far as the hotel itself everything else was pretty good. The location was perfect. It was walking distance from Bourbon Street, the Mississippi River, Jackson Square, and all the trolleys. Charlie at the concierge desk was very helpful in telling us where to go and how to catch the trolley. His direction it's saved us a lot of time. They do have a Starbucks at the ground floor which is very convenient and fairly priced. There is a few small bars in front which makes it great for a late night drink right across the street.

We had two different housekeepers and one was rude and one was super nice which kind of offset. The style of the hotel was modern the TV has Bluetooth access so you can connect your phone which was awesome. Every floor had a soda machine by the exit sign. The elevator system is genius!

Holiday Inn Express Philadelphia-Midtown,Philadelphia,3.0,"I wasn't impressed.  The lobby is down kind of a winding twisted path from the front door.  I had to wait to check in because only one of the three people at the front desk wasn't too busy with a personal conversation.  The room was sad.  Not threadbare, just a sad shade of gold that will probably not change as it gets worn and dirty.  More practical than attractive.  The bathroom was really small in that way makes you wonder how much smaller people were fifty years ago.  Painted surfaces seemed like they had about 10 layers of paint, wallpaper was only ripped and peeling in a few places.  And there was no safe.

The good news:  A coffee maker in the room, free wi-fi, and no bedbugs.  The hotel was a few blocks from the convention center, which is a plus.  The neighborhood seemed safe and my room on the 9th floor facing Walnut St. was relatively quiet.  The walls are thin but I had quiet neighbors.  Even though I heard phone conversations, I didn't get woken up.  There are two convenience stores across the street (Citi is the good one) so you can easily stock up on whatever you need.  I was always bumping into staff in the elevator and except for one bellman, they were always friendly.

There was a free breakfast but I didn't try it.  Staff highs and lows: Gwen (I think) at the front desk at 10 AM on 5/19 took care of things quickly and efficiently.  She was the best.  The bellman who walked into the elevator in front of me on 5/19 at about 2 PM while I was trying to get out with my luggage (and then gave me a dirty look) was about the rudest guy I encountered.

The average on Yelp is 3.5 stars but the rating details show that the recent average is more like 2.5.  I think that was about right and I'm rounding it up to 3 because 2 stars seems a little harsh.

I'm not a bartender. I dont frequent bars. Just a quiet guest at the hotel (Marr*i*t on Canal) that houses this restaurant/bar. 

Friday around 4pm, Nov. 11, 2021.

 Called for room service. No answer. Came down from my room to place a to go order. The bar was full. Didn't need a table, so I waited a little bit behind a man seated at the bar, to not disturb those eating. 

They were busy. The bartender saw, but didn't acknowledge me. Maybe a few minutes later another one came out & did. 

I asked, 
""May I place an order to pick up?"" 

""Yeah, you can, if you get out of the serving area.""

Damn.

I dont know the ""serving area"" from the table &  certainly wasn't about to jump between the people eating at the bar, when the first bartender saw me standing there several minutes ago.

Snaps, ""That's red beans and rice.""

""Yes Sir. Is that the size of the bowl?""

The snap, snort to my calm, added that I wasn't feeling too well...I should have just walked away.

I too work in customer service/hospitality & its just unnecessary to be this abrasive or unwelcoming to any patron, esp when we sense the patron isn't familiar w the environment, & isn't being abrasive or aggressive....
Customer Service 101.

For my unknowing where to stand, to jump and yell between seated patrons for attention from the other bartender who ignored my clear presence, I was 'talked to' as an ""in the way"" incompetent. 

If the food edible, it would've been worth it. It was heated/hot so that was good. But the taste was, well, Canal Street/tourist  style ""gumbo"" - too salty (even if you're a person who prefers salt) to eat & more rice soup (about 4:1) than traditional NOLA gumbo. 

The crabcakes were better than the rice soup, aka, gumbo. They were not firm, but almost liquid texture. The crab was good, just (also) heavily salted (ankles gonna burst tomorrow salty) & lacked crabcake form; Served w a slaw like side of vinaigrette vegetables that was good, and a mayo/spicy based sauce on top, also good. 

Either way, to have been treated better, spoken to less hostily, would have been appreciated. 

$35 (w tax)...discounted for airline, $22(w tax). I tipped bc well, thats what were supposed to do, but if my presence isn't appreciated my money shouldn't be either. 

Lesson: Be kind. Esp in these tough times. Esp to guests who arent aggressive or rude, & are simply patronizing your establishment - whose employer/company is a huge multimillion dollar account for yours, & that person a member of the hotel selecting board.",0.16971844293272864
"The Logan Philadelphia, Curio Collection by Hilton",Philadelphia,1.0,"I stayed at the Logan from June 11-15 2021 and was extremely dissatisfied. The service is poor and even though we stayed for 4 nights they refused to service our room (changing bed sheets and towels) citing covid restrictions.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"NEVER, EVER, EVER again will I book a room at the El Con! It is a ""con"" job...that's for sure!! My girlfriend and I, both disabled, had the most stressful spa getaway weekend of our lives! I am fighting numerous health issues including seven autoimmune disorders and extremely brittle diabetes as a necrotizing pancreatitis survivor. It is difficult for me to travel because of my many health issues and constant concern with how I will receive meals. I was delighted to be able to make these plans after 2 years involving lengthy hospital stays (to celebrate just being alive) but was in tears by the end of my weekend....

NOTE: DO NOT MISS THE SPA. Lydia is phenomenal. But save yourself the headache, book through Groupon, and stay at a Motel 6 if you want better hotel mgmt and service. The grounds are gorgeous but this is Tucson... that's par for the course for these resorts! I can look at mountains and beautiful grounds at home.

1). I booked TWO Spa packages for 2 nights which included charcuterie boards and souvenir size champagne (though neither of us drink). They gave us one board and 1 bottle of champagne. We had to ask for crackers because they forgot (even though a cheeseball was included). When I inquired about the 2nd board on Saturday, they had a hostess call to tell us they would not be sending it and made a reference to the idea we were trying to overindulge in the alcohol. No, we were more interested in the charcuterie board before our spa appt because we were starving.

2. This is not an ADA or handicapped friendly environment. There is A LOT of walking to get to rooms, the lobby, spa, etc. I was told my requests to be placed near an elevator and other accommodations would only be honored if we booked an accessible room. When I contacted Hilton Cus Svr, the front desk lied to Hilton and said they couldn't switch rooms because they were totally booked. There was ONE wedding booked on Saturday and it was completely dead on Sunday.

3) There is ONE restaurant open on the premises and it only serves rooms on Friday and Saturday between 5-9PM. Everything else had to be picked up and we would have had to drive all around 3 buildings to get to the restaurant near the lobby (I have mobility issues due to chronic lung conditions that cause extreme fatigue.) They didn't care.

4) A breakfast was to be included but no one cared to inform us of where it would be held. When I contacted the Front Desk (Augustine), I was told I could find a copy of the breakfast menu on the website.. No... only broken links there. He argued with me and finally someone came up and threw a menu on the floor. Hilton Cus Svc asked if I asked about this. No, I did not because in all of my years of traveling (US and Int'l), especially for spa getaways and secret shoppings, I have NEVER had to ask for amenities that were supposed to be included in the overall package. My bad.

5) The dinner meal offerings were meager and of a bar/grill nature...many of which I cannot consume. We tried Door Dashing it...

6) Door Dasher was not allowed to deliver food to the room...so I had to retrieve my Sat breakfast delivery from the lobby. Even though I drove, it was stone cold.... cold eggs.... great.

7) I was advised by the front desk and Hilton CS to make my own delivery arrangements closer to the room. Ok... I did....I told him I would meet him outside our gate.

8) The Door Dasher was stopped driving in the parking lot and told to leave it at the front desk. No one informed me. By the time I got to the lobby, $90 meal...stone cold. 

9) Do you know what it is like to have low blood sugar? On vacation? Because you cannot get a secure meal plan????

10) The rooms were musty; some areas could benefit from more attention. There was hair on the bathroom floor. No vent in the bathroom. The toilet seat broke from regular use (cheap, cheap plastic...my hubby is a plumbing professional... I know cheap when I see it.) Cheap, cheap bathroom amenities (you'd think they would have provided spa product samples. Who does the marketing?)

11) I called Hilton Cus Svc 4 times during my stay. I was given a case number on my last contact and told I would hear from someone in 3 days (even the email said so). Day 4, I called and was told I had to wait 3-5 days. I called on day 7 and was finally offered some options to make up for the poor service... but I refuse to take chances on a $1000 hotel booking ever again. Hilton is usually an exceptionally well run organization but this place is dragging their name through the mud!!

12) The wifi is HORRIBLE!! Not for business purposes!!

13) Don't take my word for it, read MANY of the other reviews which, I see, mgmt didn't care to respond to.  I sure should have.

Bottom line... I understand pandemic difficulties but nasty and disrespectful attitudes by staff have nothing to do with that. If you charge pre-pandemic prices and resort fees, you should provide pre-pandemic service.",0.10868055555555554
Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans Convention Center,New Orleans,2.0,"The Hilton was on a one-way street (so we could not just come in from the other direction to the wrong side of the street and lower the lift onto the curb) and its only curb cuts were at the ends of the streets. My husband, in a wheelchair, had to roll out in the street to the end of the block (the entrance was mid-block). When we needed a curb-cut closer at our apt., it took less than one morning to put it in-- how hard could it be?
The room was clean and lovely (much better than usual hotel generic) and the bed had a sheepskin mattress pad-- very comfortable.  It cost us $109 on a Thursday and Friday night.  It had a rollunder bed and a roll-in shower that did not distribute water all over the floor. 
  The staff when we arrived was wonderful and helpful.  However, after that night, we could not reach a staffperson at guest services by phone-- except the one time we called 15 times. Turns out, one person was answering the phone, checking in guests, and checking out guests. 
  When we returned at night the valet parking guy was chatting at the curb and totally ignored me.  I finally went to the desk, where I was told that the man at the curb would help me.  I replied he seemed to be busy, and he was told to help me.  So the valet stopped chatting and issued me a new ticket without asking if I had one, so I got charge twice. No one helped us out and we had to get our luggage down without a cart, although bellboys were standing idle-- remember that the phone was being answered by the  person who also checked people in and out.

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"DO NOT STAY HERE. I travel often and this is by far the worst customer service and dirtiest hotel. When we first came down for a birthday//girls weeks for 5 girls we requested two rooms 3 months in advance. I called that morning to double check and was told that both room were good I also let them know that we were coming in late. When we arrived there were no longer any more double beds. So we stayed in a king for the night with the promise of moving us to two double the following day. We called the next morning as the front suggested and they said that we would be moved. When we came downstairs the front desk was very rude. She stated there was no possible way i spoke to a gentleman because no men worked downstairs but keep in mind i checked in the night before with a male. She then proceeded to tell me that I was using a friend of Employee Rate and I get what i get. Basically insinuating that we were lucky we even received a room- that we booked months in advance. REGARDLESS, if I was on a friends rate we should not have been treated like we didn't deserved to be there. We paid just as much. At this point we wanted to just endure the rest of the weekend and make it work. We asked for a roll away bed which we called 5 times for with no apologies for any delays. It finally arrives around 2 am when we asked around 10 am that morning. The gentleman said that it doesn't come with blankets and to look in the closet. We looked in the closet and unwrapped a blanket covered in hair and body fluid stains.They dont seem to clean their sheets and just roll it up when its done being used..... We called downstairs to request a blanket and again no apology was given. JW is suppose to be a higher brand but it was like sleeping in a motel. Which frankly a Motel has better customer service.

AC Hotel by Marriott New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"DO NOT DISTURB SIGN IGNORED! Horrible!

 Just spent the works 3 days/2 nights at this hotel. In my opinion this hotel is basically a Motel 6 with a pretty lobby and 4xs the price. No place to unpack, no dresser, no drawers. I guess it was a man that designed the hotel because you can't even hang up a dress, the hanging area only fits shirts and pants, too short.

That would have been ok but the worst part was I was trying to sleep during the day and had the do not disturb sign out and housekeeping kept coming to the door and letting themselves into my room! I called and complained the first time it happened and several times after and it kept happening over and over. As soon as I would start to doze off they would be back trying to get in the room. I was even rude to one and said do no come back here and they still came back over and over, day after day. I finally checked out today and moved over to the Q&C down the street so I can finally get some sleep.  I've never had such a rude and inconsiderate housekeeping staff. I feel super sorry for the poor front desk that gets all the angry people like me dumping on them for something they didn't do. The front desk staff was nice, their job must be super hard.

"El Conquistador Tucson, A Hilton Resort",Tucson,1.0,"For my birthday weekend family and friends got rooms (10 rooms) the hotel wouldn't even give us a discount for all the rooms as we were told in the beginning that we could. The director of the bell hop described us as ""the mexicans with beer"" over the phone/ walkie talkie. There was issues for a paid for room, the hotel said the website is not a guarantee through 3rd party sites. We mentioned the hotel being a 5 star and they were happy to say NO we are a 4 star. Security came over to us and said a bartendar at the pool area said someone in the group was being rude, we confirmed with bartender that there was never a issue with our group. That was a lie, we had all the wrist bands needed to swim there were 2 adults who had there's in their bag at our pool side table again that wasn't an issue, we had them put them on. We made sure to video a lot of the other people in the pool without theres, but they were not being harrassed. Someone not even in our group apparently told security they wanted to beat him up and than Oro Valley PD was called on us when we had no clue what the problem was. At no point were any of us disrespectful, rude,  or cursing. GM shows up to address the situation, which at the end it was determined everything was good, we are fine all while being recorded on other strangers phones most likely to Facebook or snapchat how EMBARRASSING! Everyone had there Sunday bracelets to swim when these were given to us at check in we asked clearly how long we were able to swim, front desk told several of us that we could enjoy the pool all day. Security comes to our table once again and says you all have to leave because of last nights issues and you're now a liability because you checked out. That contradicts what we were told the day before, so we were told to leave. I personally went and talked to Liz the manager about the problems since we first walked in, about the issues being resolved and how we were treated, singled out, discriminated against and harrassed and she said, ""So sorry etc etc but there's nothing I can do for you, I have been instructed not to do anything for you"". I was shocked to hear those words and the lack of customer service to meet in the middle and make any of us a happy /return customer.

only given 2 sets for a party of 4 upon arrival). Restaurant service is SLOW and the manager we encountered was inept.

Courtyard by Marriott Indianapolis Northwest,Indianapolis,1.0,"UPDATE: we checked out yesterday morning. This morning we woke up to 2 additional charges to our account so we called the hotel. The woman at the front desk who answered was extremely unhelpful and rude as she laughed at us during the call like we were idiots despite us telling her that our bank said there will be an overdraft fee for the negative balance since they charged us over $400 for a $150 one night stay. At this point, we have basically been told that we are out of luck because it will take time to process so the overdraft fee is our problem. We were also told that they don't even have a record of one of the charges, they have no idea what it is or why it came out. Our bank has been extremely helpful and has since stated that they will request the overdraft fees be dropped due to it being the mistakes of the hotel, as well as dispute the unknown charge that the hotel has no record of. At least some businesses still have good customer service! 

This place is a joke... they advertise an indoor pool when it's not even open, and they don't tell you until you check in. Our AC didn't stay on when we turned it on, it ended up getting very hot even though the wall panel said 65 degrees. Rude staff who can't help with questions. My biggest issue was that we paid for a 5 person room- this is what was on the receipt and upon arrival we were told they don't have a 5 person room and we had to take a 4 person room with no change in the cost.

Not even the valet people walked up to us nor did they pay attention to me when I was trying to ask them a question. Clearly, they don't care about their jobs here because this became more obvious as I went in and approached the first person. She was at the desk closest to the door. Upond seeing me go up to her, she picked up the receiver and so I went up to the next two people who were happily gossiping.

Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans Convention Center,New Orleans,1.0,"Absolutely worst Hilton I've ever stayed in. The food was sub par, and the prices did not even come close to justifying the quality. On the first night I ordered a margherita pizza. It was the most ridiculous looking disaster I'd ever seen. The tomatoes were butchered and so thick I'm still not sure why they even bothered slicing them, just as well could've left the whole tomato on the side. The cheese was in the same state, basically a cube of cheese on each of the four slices and not even melted. The service was by far the worst I've encountered anywhere, hotel or any other establishment. If I had to compare this location, I could sum it up by saying it is the ""Walmart"" of hotels. The two people working the front desk upon our checkout were the rudest employees I've ever encountered. Nobody was helpful. Upon checking in, I was just handed my room key. No one told me my room # or even how to get to the elevators. I wasn't given information about breakfast or anything really. The morning I checked out, I inquired about getting a coffee from their coffee bar ""to-go"" and handed the front desk associate $10. I was told to have my server at breakfast get it for me because the coffee bar wasn't free. When I placed my hand on the $10 and informed them I wanted to pay for a coffee from the coffee bar, she sneered and told me to go behind the counter and make the coffee myself and then to make sure I paid for it.

Homewood Suites by Hilton New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,4.0,"I stayed at the Homewood Suites during Southern Decadence, and was very excited about staying here, as this is a brand new hotel and was very close to everything I needed in terms of nightlife, transportation and eateries in the French Quarter.

When I checked in, I checked in to a beautiful lobby with excellent staff who treated me with the best in courtesy and efficiency.  I appreciated the fact that you need a keycard to access the elevators at all hours and to access the hotel itself after dark.

My room was on the 3rd floor and had all the comforts of home, including a full kitchen with microwave.  The bed was absolutely comfortable and I had no issue with the A/C in this place, in fact the A/C was so powerful I had to turn UP the temperature a few degrees!

Unfortunately....I did have two major problems with this brand new property.  The first one has to do with... cleanliness.  The face towels in the bathroom were rolled up as they usually are.  However, when I unrolled one to use it, not only did a used eyelash brush pop out, but the towels (both of them) were spotted.  Grossed, I went down to the front desk and talked to the manager about it, who immediately had fresh towels sent up, with an apology and a comped night for the inconvenience.  With that problem solved, I went out for the evening.

When I returned to the hotel, I asked the young lady that was on duty (it was after 10pm so two words, night shift) if I could have a late check out.  She was rude in her answer.  I had to do a double take and asked her ""excuse me?""  She then repeated her answer (which was ""NO"") and I decided to deal with it in the morning.

The next morning I spoke with the manager on duty, who was very apologetic and took ownership of BOTH situations.  He even offered to give me a late checkout, which I accepted.  Speaking with the manager made up for both issues that occurred, and made me a fan again.  Next time I'm in NOLA, I'll give them another shot.",0.13603779732811994
Hilton Garden Inn Tampa Ybor Historic District,Tampa,1.0,"Extremely underwhelming. The front desk was so rude when I went to check in. My account had my maiden name and I'm recently married. I didn't think of changing it on my account but none the less my first name is the same. They gave me such a hard time and booking online was unclear about when you'd be charged. I thought I already paid when I got confirmation info but I was charged there then I was charged again for breakfast that someone staying with me paid for in cash. The toilet paper holder broke when it was used, no one wanted to help get us ice (we stayed on the first floor where there is no ice machine) or a bottle opener from the bar. It's like everything we needed was an inconvenience to them. Oh, and never was I informed that I would be charged for parking. So I paid about $200 for one night, $15 for breakfast that used to be complementary AND I had to pay to park where I'm staying? I don't recommend this place AT ALL. Not a good experience and won't be back.",-0.04305555555555555

I told her I left them on the night stand. When I came to my room after work my earrings was gone. She treated me like she's was the victim. She rudely cut me off while trying to talk to her. I waited a month with still no results. After pushing. She told me she was willing to reimburse me $150, I rejected. I called to try to report this but got no email or returned contact as promised. Last when I checked out, they would not give me a receipt. I told them that is not acceptable and terrible practice of policy. I was told I'm banded from there. They also told me because I book for longer they would charge me for the time after I checked out. They charged me for an additional week after I had already checked out. Residence Inn Indianapolis Northwest was the worst place I've ever been. They are not good for the Marriott franchise. I don't know how or where to report this incident.

Motto By Hilton Philadelphia Rittenhouse Square,Philadelphia,3.0,"Minimalist hotel is another way to say upscale hostel. The rooms are very small with essentially no luxuries to speak of - bed, TV, small shelves, shower, sink and toilet. The walls are thin and we were subjected to 2am noise in the hallway that kept us up for almost an hour until security got the rude guest to cease banging on doors. Mask wearing in the lobby is mandatory but not enforced so expect about a 75% compliance rate. The noise off Market St can be excessive on weekend nights when drag racing appears to be the activity of choice in Philly for late night fun. What's good?

Best Western Tampa,Tampa,1.0,"I had the displeasure of being placed in room 101, which translated to 45 minute worth of sleep for me! The room and facility were clean, most of the staff was friendly. The parking places were very tight. The thing that bothered me most about the room was the noise! It was located right behind the reception desk, which was noisy. What I didn't know until about 4 AM was it was right across the hall from were they host the continental breakfast. I had the reception desk noise ongoing most of the night. I decided to turn on the TV to drown out that noise, it was helpful but not that effective. Sometime around 4 AM they started what seemed to be an endless unpacking of supplies and preparing for the continental breakfasts, the door constantly opening and closing from the front desk to the hallway, slamming shut every time. It just got worse from there, when the continental breakfast was open at 6:30 I knew it because people would come down look over and comment loudly when they walked up to it. hey that looks good, oh the have eggs, etc. I could hear people in that room talking while they were eating, pots and pan clanking I really would have gotten more sleep in the car! 

if I were management this would be the last room I put someone in and it would be with a disclaimer and deeply discounted. If you stay here watch what room they give you.

"The Inn at Penn, a Hilton Hotel",Philadelphia,2.0,"I had very high hopes based on other reviews but was disappointed. I came to Philadelphia for the first time to attend my son's graduation from Penn. I am not a rich person by any means and I booked my room one year in advance and feel that the Hilton Franchise must assume that anyone who stays in their hotels over graduation weekend can afford the $609.00 a night room not including tax with a four night minimum. Did I agree to this? Yes! but I don't agree with the fact that they jack the prices up so high. As a matter of fact my son was on a full academic scholarship because this would have never been a University I could have sent him to otherwise. I did appreciate the fact that his housing was located right next to the hotel as was the Penn Bookstore. The customer service was very hit and miss and the room was not even as nice as some places I have stayed in Reno Nevada, which is close to my home. The refrigerator was unplugged when I got to my room and the freezer had thawed into the tray underneath and I had to try and empty it in the bathroom sink and I never got the microwave I requested a week before. The room never seemed to be dusted the entire time I was there either. The two women working the desk the morning I checked out were down right rude because I asked for a room service charge to be removed for food I never received but my biggest concern with this hotel is that they put not one but two different holds on my credit card for two different amounts of money without my knowledge! They never told me they were doing it and did not have me sign anything. Most hotels take an imprint of your card for any charges to the room for which are not paid but they don't run those charges until you check out. I did not learn of the holds on my account until I got home the next day and Shirley was less than helpful when I called. Again, I am not a rich person! In fact the card I was using only had a $1000 credit limit on it and I was $11.00 from being overdrawn. This practice is not acceptable!

"The Inn at Penn, a Hilton Hotel",Philadelphia,1.0,"This hotel is extremely overpriced. You should never stay here. There are plenty of other hotels in the area. This was the worst hotel experience I have had in my entire life.

When we checked in, they did not inform is that the breakfast was not free (like at most hotels), so I went in to have breakfast to find out it was $18. Still thinking it was free, I ordered an omelet, which brought me to $22. The food wasn't even as good as the complimentary breakfasts we had at the other hotels on the trip. When I tried to explain this to the waitress, she was extremely rude and explained that I had to charge it to the room and there was nothing I could do about it. When I explained that I couldn't afford it, she said ""too bad"" and walked away. I went to the front desk and told them that they didn't tell us anything about a breakfast price. She told me the same thing adding that ""your dad gave us his credit card so he must be able to pay for it."" I told her that even the hotel was a treat and asked to speak to her manager. Her manager did absolutely nothing expected offer to take the omelet off ($4) to which I said no because $4 is nothing considering what they charged me. I she said that the manager of the ""restaurant"" sets the rules and she can't do anything about them. I asked the waitress if I could speak with the restaurant manager, and she gave me the evil eye and was very rude, but finally agreed. The restaurant manager said everything the concierge said in a sweet, saccharine voice and offered again to take the $4 off. She finally agreed to give me a refund but then called my dad instead expecting him to say it was no big deal and to pay for the breakfast. When he asked her to please take off the charge, there was a long awkward silence and finally have in. At this point, I had spent 2 hours debating with the people who I was paying to serve me.

Holiday Inn Express New - Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"We had the WORST experience with the staff. We were woken up in the middle of the night and kicked out of our room, which we paid for. My friend's husband had too much to drink and demanded his wife leave the room. He woke us up at 2:00 am and told her to leave. He left the room and she called the front desk to ask if there was another room available. After placing my friend on hold for several minutes, the woman told her she was sending up a security guard and hung up on her. A security came into the room a few minutes later and demanded that we leave. I informed him that my name was on the room and I had paid for 1/2. He said I could stay but my friend had to leave because her name wasn't on the room, even though it was her husband who had booked it. We packed all of our belongings after explaining to the security guard the situation. We went down to the lobby to find a place to stay since it was now 2:30 am and we were just forced to leave our room. The woman behind the front desk was very rude to us and was treating us as though we had done something wrong. Meanwhile, the man who was drunk, had caused a scene, woke his wife up in the middle of the night to throw her out of the room was allowed to stay and given power and control. We were yelled at by the woman, who also brought 2 men over to intimidate us in the lobby. I took out my phone and took a video of how she treated us. I asked her several times to please give us 5 minutes to figure out where we were going. We had tried to handle the mess without a scene. We tried to quietly get another room before we were forced out of the one we had already paid for, but she had hung up on us, so we no longer wanted to stay in a hotel that would treat us this way.

They had a hotel full of drunk college kids, this drunk man throwing his wife out, and a drunk girl in the lobby that didn't make any sense, but they were mistreating and yelling at the 2 calm women who were just woken up and thrown out of their room.",-0.16682222222222226
Holiday Inn Express New - Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,2.0,"The only reason they deserve 2 stars instead of 1 is due in part of the person that handled our check in.  She was prompt and friendly.  That's about where everything went down hill.  The rest of the staff was rude and unwilling to accommodate or even try to accommodate any requests to the point where they acted annoyed or completely ignored us.   We had 10 rooms amongst our group for a wedding and asked for a few be near or on the same floor.  For the ones that asked that weren't completely ignored, they were told the hotel was sold out.  We checked the website and there were rooms showing available.   For the others, the request was responded to by a look of annoyance and nothing more, not a word.  Early in our stay we asked for an additional towel and an additional blanket.   There were 4 of us on the reservation and only 3 towels.  Not a big deal but when we called down to the front desk to requests the additional items, we were told they'd contact housekeeping.  About an hour and a half later, we didn't get the items.  We went to the front desk and you'd of thought we asked for the world with the amount of attitude we got.  There were additional problems encountered by our group that was similar to these experiences.  It was a big disappointment and the worst experience with an IHG property we've ever encountered.  We will not be staying here in the future when our travels lead us to New Orleans. It's not even close to what you expect from IHG.",-0.05165656565656567
Tampa Marriott Water Street,Tampa,3.0,"The Tampa Marriott Waterside Hotel and Marina is a huge property that, given its proximity to the Tampa Convention Center (right across the street), caters very much to the business traveler and conventioneers. Located right on Tampa's Riverwalk, the hotel is within an easy walk of the Amalie Arena and Sparkman Wharf and, with a streetcar stop right outside the hotel, makes for easy access to the Florida Aquarium and Ybor City. However, there are some downsides to the hotel's location. While affording nice views if your room is facing the river, the Convention Center and nearby highway overpasses serve to isolate the hotel a bit, with very few restaurants or services within a short walk. You'll definitely meet quite a few very friendly Uber drivers during your stay who will get you where you want to go and, for those of you who want to go a bit further afield, there's a Hertz counter right inside the hotel.

The property is sporting Marriott's new room décor, which is a welcome improvement over the 'classic' Marriott look, with the rooms much more modern-looking and making use of lighter colors to give a bigger sense of space. Your room will feel even bigger if you're on the marina side, where the big sliding glass doors will take you out onto your own private balcony. You can easily get some exercise in at this property, having a large gym with a lot of equipment and cardio options, and be sure to bring your bathing suit along for a dip in the hotel's huge pool, complete with outdoor bar. 

I did experience a few glitches during my stay, though. My first room had a somewhat unwelcome surprise - a refrigerator when, once opened, let the most foul smell out and into the room, almost like the previous guest had packed it with what smelled like salami. (Shouldn't Housekeeping have checked the fridge after the last guest checked out?) Back downstairs I went, and Shawnessy at the front desk quickly got me into a new room on a high floor. (Thank you!) There was also one morning where, after my room was cleaned, I wondered why the housekeeper decided not to leave any large towels in my room but, with a quick few taps on the Marriott app, someone swung by with the towels right away. That same app, though, failed me when submitting a request for someone to come by and address the slowly draining toilet in my reassigned room - and, when I brought it to the attention of the manager on duty downstairs, let's just say the body language was rather cold. Yes, the décor is nice, but the upkeep is apparently a bit lacking.

Fortunately, I can also point to some really excellent examples of what hospitality is all about, especially when it comes to the Concierge Lounge, one of the nicest ones I've seen at a property this size. The breakfast is quite generous, as is the evening service, and the lounge is open all day, offering snacks and beverages in between service. It was also a great place to just go and get a little work done, a quiet modern space where you can just spread out a bit and catch up on stuff back home. Of course, the best part of the lounge experience was getting to know Carl, Dorcas, and Miss Joyce during my stay. They are nothing short of fabulous and really were the stars of my stay.

So, a mixed review for the Tampa Marriott Waterside. It certainly is convenient for anyone attending a convention across the way, but there are also a number of other hotels in proximity to the Convention Center, so you do have options. If you're a leisure traveler without a car, and with little to do downtown, you may want to think about an alternate location. Three stars.",0.16147872080970674
Tampa Marriott Water Street,Tampa,1.0,"I went to the Marriott on my birthday with three friends to start a walk on the Riverside with a good Bloody Mary.

No one looked at us.  No one said ""I'll be right with you."":  It was an instance of being totally ignored - something I have not experienced at other Marriott hotels I've been too - and eaten at.  I will not come back here again - and will not recommend it to any of my friends - all locals.

Tampa Marriott Water Street,Tampa,1.0,"Stay far, far away. Nice location and layout but it's an oddly unfriendly group. The people who stand out as superb: Alex at the bell stand, and Luz, at the waterside grill. These were the only two who get it. The concierge was exceedingly rude and dismissive, the bar staff in the lobby bar left us at our table for 33 min without greeting us, even after I flagged a guy who looked like a manager (who also couldn't be bothered to take a drink order), and our check-in experience was rather pedestrian. And that was just the first day. 

The second night, there were six people outside and no servers, so after 10+ min, I went inside. Long story short, the bartender almost assaulted me and the s*** show continued. Three different servers ignored our table throughout the rest of the night - two never looked, one said she had something else to do first. Just an awful place. A sweet manager named Marisa tried her best (and was awesome), but she couldn't overcome the incompetence around her.

Holiday Inn Express New - Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"BED BUG problem. Your worst nightmare could be when staying in a hotel! 

My wife and I woke up in the morning feeling inchy, and we found a small red bug crawling on the comforter. Gosh! My wife killed it and found that it was full of blood, leaving a stain on the comforter. 

We searched our king bed for more bugs, and found two things: 1. a dead body of one bigger bug  and 2. a big blood stain on the left bottom corner of the sheet. The sheet must have not been changed before we moved in!! We looked up the internet and confirmed what we saw was indeed a bed bug. Bed bugs are vermin that live in your bed, clothes and even your hair, feed on your blood, proliferate rapidly and are incredibly difficult to get rid of.

We called room service and informed them the bed bug problem. They sent a person up, who investigated the bugs and told us that they had a full house and cannot move us to another room. Her attitude was rude and was not apologetic at all. She left right after.

Later on, we went to the front desk to confront the person in charge, who is also very rude. We asked her if the hotel could clean our belongings and make sure they don't contain bed bugs. The women told us that the hotel will only take care of the hotel room and is not responsible to us whatsoever. 

My wife questioned her that if a person has food poison in a restaurant, should the restaurant take care of the person? The woman looked completely indifferent and told us that she worked in many hotels before and this is the way that hotels do things. She even implied that the bed bugs may be brought by other travelers and not be the responsibility of the hotel. However, it is possible that because they didn't change the sheet so we got the bugs! And she refused to offer any help!

We were extremely angry so we told other people in the hotel what happened to us. This made her very nervous, and she connected us to the hotel manager immediately, who offered to take care of our belongings and transferred us to another room. 

So far, we are still waiting for the hotel to sterilize our belongings, hoping that we won't bring any bug home. Professional bed bug treatment is very expensive and extremely labor intensive. Because of this event, our vacation at New Orleans is ruined. My wife spent hours arguing with them and we worry that we catch the bug eggs in our clothes and hair. And worst of all, the hotel persons are very irresponsible and indifferent to us, not willing to help. We post this review simply to warn and advice other travelers of this unfortunate situation we have experienced and hope to reduce the chance of its happening again in the future.

PS. They offered us the first night free of charge, but this offer had no appeal to us since the whole trip was not paid by us. What we cared is our hygiene, which they refused to offer help.",-0.009359399465782443
Best Western Tampa,Tampa,1.0,"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Service by front desk woman and Manager. I had made a reservation for 3 nights over 2 months ago for this property that I had stayed at many,many times over the past several years. Upon arrival, I noticed a notice to the side of the check-in desk that stated that thIs property will not have any electric from 9pm tonight until tomorrow. I asked the front desk woman why I wasn't notified by e-mail or telephone and how long had they known about this? She stated that she knew for 3 days and that e-mails and telephone calls were made. I told her that I NEVER received either and that wasn't the truth. She just shrugged her shoulders and said ""Oh well"". She then replied""You need to understand how much revenue we have lost over this"".  I replied that I don't care how much revenue was lost because I have a small child with me and this will not be suitable to stay without electric. She shrugged her shoulders again and said-""Look--I'm tired"". I replied that I didn't really care how tired she was-I need to find a last minute place to stay. She never apologized. The disheveled Manager came out-made no apologies and said I called you. I said-""No you did not Sir-that is a lie"". You can check all my calls on my phone and see all my e-mails on my phone right now. He said you need to leave right now or I am calling the police. We are not animals here?!?!

What do you want me to do?"" Also, they charged us for two rooms when I called in to request a king room. When I told them that it was a double charge, they charged me a $200 fee to cancel the room, even though I found someone to take the room for them. Not all staff were rude!! Some tried to help us.

Holiday Inn Express New - Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"We stayed at this Holiday Inn Express overnight from Saturday to Sunday. To start our experience here was already poor. The lady who was checking our group in (we reserved 2 rooms) was from the start was already rude and lacked any sense of customer service. She was very short with sentence that she iterated. Our group was able to put that behind us. 

The next poor experience that we had was that part of our group (who had another room) had BED BUGS, in both beds. Pictures attached. When they brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, Michelle, who handled this issue, was very nonchalant about it. She did not show any sign of sympathy that guests of the hotel had bed bugs in the room. She simply said, ""We will reassign you a room""....not even an apology or offer to improve our experience.

As if bed bugs, were not enough for a poor experience. I went downstairs to register one of our vehicles to the room. In the hotel's defense I did mess up our room numbers...but again Michelle gave more negative attitude towards me. She made me feel like I was bothering or taking up her time by mistaking our rooms for a different room number. There was no one in line behind me nor was the phone ringing. So I said I would go upstairs and go get the room number, Michelle's response ""Yeah, you better go do that"", with a snide attitude again. While this was happening the lady that had checked our group in was leaving for the day and the two were having a conversation while I was trying to address the issue of registering our vehicle. From a customer service perspective the conversation could have waited and should have waited for a couple of reasons. One, it makes me the patron feel unimportant because my needs were put to the side. Two, the conversation they had was about petty cash that was missing. The lady who was trying to leave was so carefree about missing petty cash. She told Michelle, it would eventually show up and if it didn't she shrugged her shoulders and left the building. As a customer to hear that conversation was unprofessional and again, goes to show how much they did not care for their jobs. I truly feel sorry for the business owner of this establishment. On the room key there are words which I assume they want their employees to live by whole working...two of those were were attitude and responsibility...these two women lacked a positive attitude towards the patrons and their jobs, and absolutely no responsibility to their jobs. 

Finally, today, the morning of checkout, another poor experience occurred. It had first around 8:30am and again around 9:00, we were still in bed. Housekeeping barged into our room to begin cleaning. The first time we did not get up fast enough to tell them we were not ready for them to come in, but the second time they just opened the door without even knocking. So after this, we decided to put out a do not disturb sign, but we did not have one to put on the door.

Holiday Inn Express New - Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"I would give no stars if it were possible. We arrived at the property at ~11 and we knew we were too early for check-in so we just asked the front desk to hold our luggage, which they did. We returned after 3pm to check in and there was a blonde woman at the front desk who told us it would be an hour+ before we could check in but she claimed she put our name on a list to get the next room. I asked her why our name was not put on the list when we first arrived if this was going to be an issue and she retorted with a very nasty attitude that ""check in is at 3"" so I retorted ""then check us in"" because it was after 3. Perhaps if she didn't get an attitude with guests when it is HER who is not honoring the terms of the stay, I would have had a better start to this experience. She then argued with me that we had a ""unique room type"" of executive suite, to which I reply that we did not - we had booked a standard room with two queen beds. She was just lying to justify her attitude and the hotel's inability to uphold their side of the terms of stay. They don't check you in on time, but they expect you to check out on time. 

They then put us in the smallest hotel room I have ever seen. The beds were doubles, not queens, and the sink was in the room, not in the bathroom. The bathroom didn't even have a door - it just had a sliding wooden piece that offered you no privacy whatsoever. You can still engage in the conversation while peeing! The closet and two drawers are unusable because the smell of mildew is so powerful. Housekeeping did a poor job of cleaning the room to the point of the previous guest asking us for her charger, which was still plugged in. 

The beds were not only small but they were uneven. I felt like I was fighting not to roll off the bed all night and woke every morning with a sore back. The one bed is flush against the sink! You can wash your hands without ever leaving bed! The floors had not been vacuumed. One night the keurig machine in the room, which we had not put water in, leaked water all over the desk and soaked our belongings which we could not put in the drawers/closet due to mildew and we were afraid to put on the floors. Of course, we had to clean that up ourselves because housekeeping will not clean your room. (Newsflash, it was debunked a year ago that COVID can stay on belongings. There's no reason why housekeeping can't clean a room while the guests are out for the day)

This hotel is filthy. They refuse to clean your room throughout your stay, they don't provide you with any trash bags, and they tell people to just throw their trash and dirty linens in the hallway. That means that every time you leave your room, your are walking down hallways piled with garbage and dirty linens/towels. Which housekeeping does not collect. The one trash can by the ice machine was overflowing. The front desk acts like you're an inconvenience when you have to go begging for a clean towel or a roll of toilet paper. And do I blame them? No. The way the hotel is being run here is inefficient and nonsensical. 

Maybe the reason why they can't check guests in on time is because their housekeeping staff can't clean the rooms throughout the stay, which means when they finally get in to clean, they are cleaning a pigsty! Of COURSE that is going to take them longer! They claim that it's due to COVID that they can't clean or supply the room with conveniences like toilet paper and towels but the front desk is touching all of that stuff regardless. What difference would it make if the housekeeper does?! They are just trying to cut corners economically for themselves.

At breakfast, you have to go up to a window and ask for what you want. They have one girl working in there who is often on her phone and doesn't notice that you're even there. Again, I don't blame her. What a dumb job. You guard your breakfast items under the guise of COVID but then there's twelve people mouth breathing on the coffee products. It's a joke. They don't care about COVID, they care about policing what people take from the breakfast area back up to their rooms (where people are undoubtedly leaving old food laying around the room all week - gross). 

NO STARS. This was the worst hotel stay of my life and I have stayed in hostels, bunking with complete strangers from around the world, which had more amenities and better quality. I sincerely feel badly for some of the staff.

The hotel smelled sooooo bad and the rooms were very small. The door does not shut on its own, so you have to make sure you pull it shut tight or you can accidentally leave it open. The bathroom door is a sliding barn door, that allows for no privacy and no ventilation....so needless to say the tiny rooms can fill up with the stench of your partner very easily.

Charge for wifi-crazy, glad we did not get a rental car, parking charge was crazy expensive. Everything in the little shop on the second floor was very expensive and the staff were rude.

Next time, we will try someplace different.",-0.02986111111111113

Charged $7 a day for parking, $10.65 a day for wifi, had NO coffee in the lobby or conference room.  Staff was RUDE! They have a ""pond"" in the lobby... water was brown, foamy, and smelled. The conference room was either 50 degrees or 85. There was no medium.  We kept getting power jolts which cause the lights to flicker. I peeked at the breakfast bar... teeny stale looking muffins and itty bitty yogurts, they had a milk dispenser with a jar of Hershey's syrup next to it instead of chocolate milk. The only positive was the bathrooms were reasonably clean and the water with fruit in the lobby was good. Would not recommend this place for ANY business needs.",0.05236742424242424
Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"Staying here for a business meeting and they want to charge an outrageous amount per day just to use a power strip in the conference room. The staff is incredibly rude. Hope you don't want breakfast in the hotel, because it's $17 for a crappy omelet, standard breakfast accompaniments and some cold cuts.  

My coworker checked in to her room and found the remnants of what appeared to be a slice of pizza in her bed.  After calling the front desk to get new sheets, she returned to her room to find that housekeeping had remade the filthy bed with the same sheets!

Another coworker had a package shipped to him via the US Postal Service.  Instead of delivering the package to his room or holding it at the front desk like every other hotel in the world, they sent it to a FedEx office and charged a $18 fee to release the package.

If there were any other hotel in New Orleans that could accommodate our group, we would have left this hotel on the second day of our two week stay.  This hotel looks really nice at first glance, everything is brand new, but I would recommend to anyone that you stay away from this hotel.
Manager Cecelia tried to make things right by sending milk and fresh baked cookies to the folks in our group who had been traumatized the most, but it was too little, too late. 

This remains the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  And I've stayed in some pretty nasty Motels in my younger years...

I did find the sushi bar at Vitascope Hall is good and very moderately priced.  If I had to stay there any longer, my diet would be heavy with Starbucks for breakfast, lunch would be a mix of sushi and BBQ baked potatoes from Whole Hog, and dinner would be sushi mixed with trips out to WalkOns, Reginellis Pizza, and Acme Oysters.

Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing,Philadelphia,1.0,"I stayed here for two nights for a wedding over this past Memorial Day weekend. The wedding was lovely and the rooms were decent but the service, particularly the manager i dealt with at the front desk, was unfortunately (for me) unsatisfactory in her performance and a bit rude.  

The criticism i have for the staff is that are either not trained well and/or just don't care about what they're doing.  First about the manager I dealt with though. On Sat. during the wedding we were on i believe the second floor in one of the ballrooms. Internet was not available (i need it to check emails for work).  I ended up going to the front desk. I explained that during the wedding i needed internet access to check my emails for work. What I got was, ""you only get internet here in the lobby and in your room. If you want Internet in the ballroom you need to speak with a Business Specialist"". Basically, unless i was renting a conference room with the hotel i wasn't allowed access to their wifi.  Granted, i would have needed internet access on the Ballroom floor for a good 4-4.5 hours but NOPE, this manager could not have been bothered to give me the access code for those 4 hours. She essentially said to rent a conference room if i wanted internet access or get lost and seemed to have taken pleasure in letting me know that she would not be helping me. Now recall, that we stayed in the hotel for two nights (weren't just there the day of the wedding).

The next incident was minor but i believe it needs to be mentioned. The morning after the wedding my family and i met in the Executive Lounge for breakfast around 9am. It was fairly crowded as expected (popular time).  Directly next to our table one of the staff decided to start sorting and placing the silverware which was VERY NOISY.  Now, i have no issue with the actual act as i know it' part of her job but did she not realize the noise was great and she was directly next to us? She obviously did not because this went on for a good five minutes and i found it to be quite disturbing. She was very nice so i don't think it was intentional but i do think it's not appropriate to be doing that inches away from a table of people trying to eat their breakfast and enjoy time together. Most likely it did not occur to her or perhaps someone could have figured out that maybe that wasn't the best place to do such a thing but it happened and i did not appreciate it at the time.  

Was the hotel itself decent? All in all, yes (nice location). Was it the hotel's staff decent? I'd say sadly that they were subpar in my experience.  Would I use them again or recommend them? Probably not.",0.15962962962962962

It's got a good location - right near city hall and lots of restaurants. 

My favorite part about Residence Inns are the hot breakfast. This hotel did not disappoint. The breakfast was good - eggs, breakfast meat, fruit, etc. Definitely a better selection than I've had at some.

Four Points by Sheraton Philadelphia Northeast,Philadelphia,1.0,"On 6/3/16 my family and I attended a wedding at the Four Points/Sheraton in Philadelphia, PA. I called the day before (6/2/16) to confirm our reservation and ensure the room would be ready for our 3pm check-in so we would be on time for the wedding we were there to attend. I also stated that we would be using the sofa bed and would need that to be prepared with linens as well. 
We arrived to the hotel at approximately 2:45 pm and were told our room was not ready for our 3 pm check in and would not be ready until 3:45 pm which made us late for the wedding we were attending. When we attempted to speak to the supervisor, Michelle, she blatantly ignored us. We again attempted to speak to her and she yelled at us ""we're overbooked""! I want to be clear that Michelle was unprofessional and literally yelled at us. 
When we first arrived to our room, there was food all over the floor in the hallway and directly in front of our door. When we left the next day, the food was still there. The hallway was never cleaned. 
After entering our room we immediately realized there was no bedding for the sofa bed; we called down to ensure this would be taken care of before we returned after the wedding. After returning to the room after the wedding the bedding was not provided and we had to call down 4 times before we received adequate linens; please note that staff had to return to the room twice before everything was provided. 
We were charged $200 for our one night stay. The customer service was substandard and in fact rude and hostile. The accommodations and service were also substandard, unsanitary and totally unacceptable. This was not a $200 a night hotel.

Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"The hotel is 4th tier quality. Beautiful and the restaurant Borge is delicious. That's about all the good there is to say about this hotel. From our check in to leaving the hotel it was a terrible experience. As my husband was parking I waited in line to check in only to be told I wasn't allowed to because the reservation was under his name. But after waiting for ten minutes the same employee walks up and hands me paperwork telling me we are being transferred to a different 3rd tier hotel because they overbooked. (So I can't check in but they can hand me the paperwork saying we've been kicked out and demoted????). Being Platinum members we were a little peeved but transferred and returned to the regency the next day for the duration of our stay.

Only to arrive to a dirty room filled with IHOP cups a rolling bed and dirty towels on the floor. After getting the second dropped ball fixed we were in a new room with a shower that didn't drain so your ankle deep in your own filth! Sweet! We have a pretty high tolerance and really didn't want to switch again. We just called management again to be told they were very busy and will put it on the maintenance list. The actual leader manager finally called the next day and in a nutshell we got everything free with more amenities. Kudos to that manager but there was so much hassle and arguing it wasted half our trip just dealing with all the issues.

Residence Inn by Marriott New Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"The mental scars from our stay in this hellhole are still quite fresh.  Here's the short version: we would have rather spent the night in a truck-stop bathroom, with our heads resting in a urinal.

Here's the long version: The first room we were assigned was filled with rodent droppings; there were bodily fluids caked on the upholstered furniture; and signs of bedbugs.  We left the room immediately.  A woman at the front desk was helpful and gave us a new room.  This room looked similar to an alley-way after Mardi Gras.  It had obviously not been cleaned after the last few guests and had obviously not been repaired or maintained for years.  There was:
* Vomit on wall
* Blood on the bed sheets
* A dirty towel hanging up
* Semen crusted on the chair
* Clumps of hair in bathroom
* Mold in shower
* A dead mouse outside the door (in later stages of decomposition) 

Realizing that we could not stay here, we began calling other hotels and trying to find a place downtown that had vacancies for the weekend and accepted large dogs.  To our horror, everything was booked; exhausted and in the midst of a cross-country move, we were forced to stay in this hellhole.

I'm going to give you the short version of my terrible experience with this place. I booked a room for Saturday and Sunday nights. Due to a personal emergency, I was unable to make it to the hotel Saturday night. I called on Sunday to inquire about moving my two night reservation to Sunday and Monday, which they declined, but told me I could still stay on Sunday. So I still have the room for Sunday night, right? Right... I show up to check in on Sunday, a night that I had already paid for, and the woman tells me that since I didn't call on Saturday to let them know I wasn't showing up until Sunday, they cancelled my entire reservation. If I wanted to stay there that night, which I had RESERVED AND PAID FOR, I was going to have to make a new reservation and pay AGAIN. I felt like they were trying to punish me for missing my curfew! When I RESERVE a room, it doesn't matter when I check in. The room is RESERVED for me to come and go as I please during the time I paid for it! They had $400 of my money and an empty room that I had paid for, but would not let me stay in it unless I paid them another $200 since I didn't call to cancel my Saturday night reservation. 

I wrote an email to their customer service when I returned home, which was several weeks ago, and have yet to receive a response. I travel very frequently for both work and pleasure and have NEVER been treated so unfairly and disrespectfully in my life.

The restaurant inside the hotel advertises a dinner special, but not everything comes as advertised. The special includes asparagus, yet zucchini is given. This happened again a few days later. I don't understand why the menu wasn't changed if it's impossible to deliver what's advertised. 

My room was clean, but there were no dirty clothes bag to put my dirty stuff in and there wasn't a spare roll of toilet paper in the room. These are all small things to complain about, but when it adds up and I'm having to spend my own time on getting things that I shouldn't have to be doing, it starts to get annoying.

The fitness center has some really nice equipment. It happened to be out of handy-wipes to wipe down a machine before use. I went to the front desk and asked if they could send someone to refill it. That someone never showed up and no one followed up to verify it was taken care of. I don't know about you, but I prefer a clean machine prior to using them because many people are rude and do not clean up after themselves after using a piece of gym equipment. 

Parking is atrocious and whether or not you get your parking validated for the week, the automated machine still eats your ticket where you have to keep going back to the front desk to have the new one validated. SMH!

And finally, when I booked my reservation, I purchased the premium internet package as a part of my booking. After check-in, I called down to the front desk to ask how it worked. Simply choose the Premium Wi-Fi connection, agree to the $10 fee, enter your room number and name and voila. The premium internet is far from premium. It's jut as slow as the standard sign-on, yet they market it anyway. My frustration came upon checkout where Shenaykay tried to charge me for each day I used the premium internet. I explained I purchased the premium as a part of booking and she insisted they didn't offer that at their location. So I asked her why Hilton sold me the package.  She said she didn't know. So I showed her in the app how the room was booked and THEN she believed me. Chalk this up as just another annoyance. 

Two good things about this establishment. The breakfast chef, Vince. He is always bright and cheerful and can make anything you want for breakfast. What a great guy and he has such a positive attitude helping everyone begin their day with a smile. The other is waitstaff, Kendra.

The hotel's location is GREAT.  However, the main drawback here is the INSANE amount of noise.  I can usually sleep fairly well with moderate noise but the doors and walls do NOTHING to keep the noise out.  Certainly a lot of the blame goes to the rude and disrespectful patrons sharing the Westin that night, but the staff or security should have done something as we were awake both nights from 2-5am on as people apparently stumbled back from the bars.",0.009623015873015872

Well I have, and unfortunately the Embassy Suites could not help me with that! After my nice rainy walk to the nearby Courtside Marriott to get said ""cup of joe"" I returned to my towel-less room to prepare to shower. I then had my buddy call the lobby for some towels, let's just say the pleasure of speaking to one of the rudest individuals was all his to continue this dreadful experience. Ten minutes later, when the towels were delivered, we decided to order pizza from our nearby tour bus to try to put a, which seemed unrealistic at the time, smile on our faces. The pizza came and we thought it was a great idea to go enjoy it in the beautiful lobby which looked very inviting, boy were we wrong! Another extremely rude individual told us that the 24 empty tables were not for outside food, but our room was. We then walked back through the rain to our bus, that if was equipped with a shower, would have spared us the nightmare of a morning that the ""Embassy Sours"" was so stoked to provide us.

I had multiple issues during my time staying there of which the most important was I was staying in a Club Level room which was supposed to include complimentary premium WiFi (whatever that means). Being on a business trip, WiFi is pretty crucial. WiFi never ONCE worked and i spent over 2 hours on the phone with their corporate tech support all for them to tell me it was a local issue in New Orleans. When I went to check out I noticed on the bill a charge for this WiFi I never once was able to get to work and when I explained that to the girl she says ""I guess I can remove that charge for you but that's your fault you didn't spend more time on the phone with our tech support""... I'm sorry I didn't know 3-4 hours on the phone with tech support was a prerequisite for WiFi which normally takes all of 20 seconds to figure out. Beyond my issues there more importantly I always felt like a bother to the staff. No matter if it was a quick question or recommendation for restaurants - the front desk seemed annoyed.

I left a message describing my disappointment and requested that my room be properly serviced.  Upon my return to my room that evening at almost 8 p.m., my room was still not cleaned.  I called again, was once again transferred to voice mail, so I hung up and called Guest Services again who took a message.  I left to eat dinner.  I forgot something in the room, returned about 40 minutes ago when I met the evening manager who apologized and said everything would be taken care of.  Later that night I had candies delivered by the hotel.  The next day my room was not even cleaned!  Upon my return at almost 9 p.m. I had to call for fresh towels, which were delivered about 30 minutes later.  

In the meantime, I had two co-workers that had packages shipped via USPS to the hotel.  Instead of the hotel either delivering to the room, or holding at the front desk, they delivered to FedEx, who then charged $18 and $10 respectively for ""handling"" fees.  RIDICULOUS!  These FedEx employees were very rude when questioned about these fees.  In fact, one of my co-workers said his package would just be destroyed because the cost to return to sender would be too expensive.  On the eighth day, the house keeping people exchanged the towels but did nothing else, to include did not vacuum, sweep, clean the tub, bring new shampoo, take out the trash, or even MAKE THE BED!  After the first day that I had to request the sheets to be changed, my sheets were never changed during my entire stay. 

My refrigerator had to be changed out twice which ruined a meat tray that I had purchased for snacks for my group.  

I ordered room service once and ate in Vitascope a couple of times.  The burgers and fries and fried crawfish were excellent, but on the ninth night, I had a steak salad at Vitascope that I purchased to go to eat in my room.  I had requested it medium well.  The steak was bloody, in fact it had bled all over the lettuce, but it tasted horrible like the steak was spoiled.  I couldn't eat the salad at all.  (I normally eat my steaks medium rare, but not on my salad.)  

Other co-workers that were staying there also complained of similar issues:  Their sheets had never been changed, one requested his laundry to be picked up, a service that is offered, but wasn't picked up for two days.  He complained twice before it was picked up.  One co-worker had clothes that were left in his room from a previous guest that were never removed.  

The meeting room charges for items such as surge protectors, projector screens, etc were outrageous.  $20 a day just for a key for the meeting room that was rented!  The rooms were straighted every night, but we had to request for them to be vacuumed, I would think this would be automatic.  The last two days water nor candies were placed in our room.  Out of the 11 days, we were finally given a TRASH CAN ON THE NINTH DAY!  Many, many times we would return to our meeting room after the staff had cleaned it to find the meeting room left unlocked with our personal projector and property left unsecured.  We would have to call to have security lock the doors.  

I travel many days a year and am a Gold member with Hilton.  I have never had a stay like this in one of their properties.  I have to say that I am very disappointed and will absolutely never stay at this property again, not 100% sure that I will choose a Hyatt again.  In addition to the candy tray, I was given a $20 comp to Vitascope and milk and cookies at 10:20 p.m. one evening.  I was excited to share this city and my home state with my co-workers, but unfortunately they will always relate Louisiana to this horrible hotel stay!",-0.060871628371628364

Hyatt House New Orleans/Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,I recently stayed at this hotel and for someone who is a Hyatt member because I travel so often I was treated very poorly.

The front desk was extremely rude & rushed me out they didn't not give me my Hyatt member discount & they charged me double for valet and when I called to ask about the bill the lady was extremely rude and said their was nothing she can do.

The room itself was stinky and the bed so hard I didn't sleep through the night. The pool looked dirty on the bottom though it could have been stained. We asked if the hotel shuttle could take us to a restaurant across the street, we were rather rudely shown the sign that read airport shuttle. I've been to many hotels around the United States and many of the hotel shuttles will provide you with transportation close by. It was also loud in the room from hotel noise that could be heard through ear plugs. The air conditioner didn't get very cold either.

OK, so the place has some ups, but the downs outweigh them.
Pluses: 
-Looks nice and is clean
-Comfortable rooms
-Decent restaurants if you don't have time to pop out
Minuses:
-Horrible for conventions.  They can't handle the volume from a service standpoint.
-Poor service.  While we did run into a couple of exceptions, most of the folks working there ranged from disinterested to outright rude.  
We had one encounter where the bartender refused to make a drink because ""he'd have to leave to make a batch"".  Spoke to a manager who said they'd have the Food and Beverage manager get in touch.  Followed it up with a voicemail and guess what?  Nothing.  No response. Nada. Zilch.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,2.0,"Booked 2 rooms and was assigned two 'non-normal' conference rooms upon a still-early 4 pm arrival. Had a professional lady helping me, however when I used the term normal to describe my opinion of our room assignments, a loud-mouthed, obnoxious front desk clerk helping ANOTHER GUEST started confronting me about the use of the word -normal . So rude -didn't stop expecting an elaboration on my idea of 'normal'. Tells her next guest to wait as she's still waiting for a response. I didn't put it all together until my wife and guests became aware of what she was referencing and told me after I left the front desk area. Nothing worse than an inflammatory LESBIAN, BI,GAY, TRANSGENDER flaming radical being assigned a job where she is the first contact a 'normal' couple come in contact with at what was my favored hotel chain. 
Carpets in room filthy. Massive tile renovation going now on entire first floor common area - not listed on their website when making the reservation. Shame on them. Even lower quality hotels give renovation-related information on their properties. The Mgr. Reception bar-maid got mad within 4 minutes of opening the bar at 5;30 because the moron's that were tipping her weren't neatly arranging the bills under her whiskey bottle. She had her tantrum as we approached, arranged her currency and slammed the whiskey bottle down on top. You guys and gals have some obnoxious individuals in your employment. Tips for customer-facing employees like these are out of the question for me. Don't expect the new GM William Denage to return your calls as it's been 36 hours and-nothing!

Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"This is also a review for Vitascope. I work in the area and was so excited to see a new restaurant open. I've given it THREE chances to win me over and my hopes have been dashed every time. 

I agree with other reviews that it makes no sense that there is no hostess station, or sign telling you to seat yourself. So we awkwardly stood trying to make eye contact with wait staff, gave up, and finally sat ourselves. Then both times we sat there wondering when our server is going to come. The third time I visited the establishment, only to order take out at the bar, I stood for 10 minutes at 12:30pm at the bar, watching bartenders and servers walk right by me or eat their own lunches at tables, before I finally stopped a waitress and asked, ""Does anybody work here?"" I mean, seriously, it was lunchtime, there was almost no one at the restaurant, and not a single one of the half dozen staff working stopped their napkin folding or chatting to ask if I had been helped. One rude male bartender standing no more than 5 feet from me, actually looked at me, looked away, and proceeded to walk to the bathroom.

On a side note, their payment system is very strange. The first time we patronized the restaurant, they immediately asked us for a credit card for verification. So I handed mine over, not really understanding why, and then had a pending charge on my card for $50 for a week. Then, before we'd even gotten our food, the waitress asked if we wanted to give her credit cards to pay our bill. Mind you, she didn't give us a bill, just asked for our credit cards. We politely declined. My co-worker was actually so fed up by the poor service that she spoke with the manager, who took down her information and promised to send her a restaurant gift card. Alas, we're still waiting on that promise.

As for the food, my seafood gumbo was very good, but others found their food to be overpriced and mediocre. I even went back a second time to get the seafood gumbo as take-out. It took them 20 minutes to bring me a giant to-go box with a puddle of sad, luke-warm gumbo at the bottom. So disappointing.

The only good thing to say about this place is that the red-head bartender was very apologetic when she realized I hadn't been helped and was livid. She's pretty much the only staff person to care about the customers in the entire restaurant.",-0.001591788969837754
Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing,Philadelphia,1.0,"I had a very poor experience with the Hilton Penn's Landing restaurant. I came a few minutes before 9:00 pm to ask for a table and was refused, because the restaurant was closing at 9:00.  The host was not interested in serving an ""old white guy"" and more interested in getting off work so he could go home. I had asked the front desk if the restaurant closed that early and was told it didn't close till 10:30. Still, Brian the host, did not wish to accommodate a long time HHonors member.  I am appalled at the lack of service at this Hilton and definitely do NOT recommend this restaurant and instead recommend steering clear to other, more friendly restaurants in Philadelphia.  If this is what Philadelphia offers as hospitality I would pass and move on to a more friendly city. 
Soooo, with the recent ""corporate"" response you'll see below,

She preceded to get an attitude with me and called her other manager Ashley so they can both tell me I'm not allowed to check into my room BC my dad needed a authorization that he obviously was not aware of. So I'm on the phone with my dad asking the manager Ashley if I can at least check into my parents room. She said it's hotel policy not to let in me the room without my dads presence.

The Westin Indianapolis,Indianapolis,3.0,"So this is a Westin thus the standards are high. For the most part it upholds the standards of a 5 star hotel. amenities are top notch. Decor is modern and very well designed. It has great restaurants although extremely pricey and all other amenities are superb. The rooms are wonderful although the ceilings could be an inch higher I felt a bit claustrophobic vertically. The beds are extremely comfortable. 

So this is a Westin and as that, everything is extremely expensive, parking expensive, internet not free etc... But this is expected. What is not expected however, is the rude staff for the price you are paying. The front desk crew is dismissive at best lacking the fundamental social skills but that is not even the problem its the bell hop and valet dudes outside. As soon as they understood that we are not paying for parking all bet were off and they turned a cold shoulder to us. My sister actually had to tell one of the to load the trunk with our luggage. This is simply unacceptable behavior for a Westin. The young kid helping us out in the evening was nice though, although he was confused why we came from California to such a dump as Indianapolis.

When I checked in the front desk person was very professional and curteous. Sounded like a great start. The room was clean and everything seemed good. However, during our stay there were several days in which our rooms were not cleaned at all. We had to constantly ask for them to be cleaned or the RUDE housekeeping would be knocking on our doors at 4pm asking when they could clean the room, even though I was out of my room the entire morning/afternoon and no one came. Their excuse was that people were checking out that day so they had a priority over us - which is good and fine, but to be coming around to BARELY start cleaning the room at 4pm is unacceptable! 

They claimed to have just shampooed the carpets in the hotel (new hotel shoudln't need to already have that much shampooing done) and it smelled pretty horrible. I dont know what they used to clean it but it definitely did not have a plesant sent. 

Even management was rude and agressive.

We had a nice view of the superdome and the rest of the city.

However, there were a few things that made me want to keep the points we spent to get this room:
- Low water pressure: The shower and bathroom sink just drizzled water. We mentioned this during check-out and the response was that they were aware of this issue and are working on it. Not sure why they would open a hotel if the water just barely works!!
- COLD water: My last shower at the hotel was COLD!!!!! and I was the first one in our group to shower that night!
- The door on our room was messed up. We had to walk back and forth to the lobby (which was a really long walk!) multiple times to talk to the front desk, wait for an engineer, get our keys reassigned and so forth.

I go down stairs to let them know and they first offer to have house keeping spray the room (clearly they know this is a problem) I told them the smell was too strong to be masked, the lady at the front desk went to go talk to her supervisor to see what else they can do.

First of all there were no sheets on the mattress... not even in the closets so we can put them on our selves and worst of all there was a stain on the couch and you could clearly tell it was semen!!!! I was EXTREMELY disgusted!!! I call front desk to let them know about the sheet and the stain. They offered to send room service to clean the stain and put sheets on....okay!

Four Points by Sheraton Philadelphia Northeast,Philadelphia,1.0,"I wish I could give these people no stars. The only saving grace was Pam Bintliff as she was polite to talk to, but came to find out she is super dishonest and not professional at all. We had reserved a room block for my wedding and she let me know that post our 25 room block that every single other room in the whole hotel was taken, I asked if she had any recommendations for other hotels in the area and her tune completely changed. Suddenly, there were more rooms, and suddenly they would be able to supply us with a larger room block. These conversations happened within an hour of eachother.

On the day of our wedding, my husband called the front desk as we were instructed to get a few early check-ins. We did not request any specific floors, so with a 2-3pm checkin, I was hoping some out of towners could get there around 1pm. The front desk woman was extremely rude to my husband and said it absolutely could not be done and they needed to stick to that original check-in time. We came to find out that guests checked in early anyway, which proves that that individual did not even look into what he was requesting.

When we toured the hotel, midsentence the woman behind the counter TOOK OUT A SLIM JIM and just started going to town. Chewing and eating and talking to me with her mouth full.

Lastly, my mother who is from out of town had to stay about 4 nights to help with pre-wedding things. She was double charged and had to call Pam about removing one of the charges.

The Westin Indianapolis,Indianapolis,4.0,"I've been debating whether or not I should review The Westin Indianapolis since my most recent experience this past weekend as a conference attendee at the Indiana Conference on Disability. While my Westin experience isn't quite the full range of the Westin Experience, I've spent enough time in the facility, the lounges, the meeting rooms, and other areas, including brief times in the rooms themselves, to feel like I can give a complete and honest review.

As has already been shared, the Westin is located in a prime downtown Indy area with a skywalk to the Indiana Convention Center and within easy walking distance to the Indiana Government Center, Circle Centre Mall, and Lucas Oil Stadium. As such, you can definitely expect to pay a higher rate than you would outside the downtown Indy area. 

The Westin has 575 rooms including 40 suites. Not surprisingly, it's a smoke free hotel and offers wifi that varies in pricing according to the type of room you choose - the most affordable ""traditional"" room involves paid wifi. 

I have to give kudos to a hotel that goes above and beyond in terms of wheelchair access - the Westin has 40 accessible rooms, a number that is actually twice the legally required amount. This is one reason, I'd imagine, they were a prime choice for the Indiana Conference on Disability. The nearby Marriott took the conference's overflow. 

I learned that three hotels within this block actually share some accessibility equipment, especially that used for conferences like ramping, and they exchange it between themselves. I know this includes the Westin and Marriott - I'm not sure if the third one is the J.W. Marriott or another one in the area. Regardless, it's a great idea and wonderfully cooperative. I'd spoken at this conference a couple years ago and they used an elevator lift for staging that wasn't particularly impressive - I also didn't think staff were very informed about using it, but I was still impressed they had it. For this conference, they had a more traditional ramp that was ADA compliant and easy to use independently. Their sound people were also well equipped at adapting sound needs to a variety of disabilities. 

The staff at Westin were uniformly friendly and helpful including contract folks for food services. I was consistently impressed with everyone's friendliness and adaptability. Even the front door staff were fantastic - at a facility that's a little more expensive, you might have thought they'd drop in service with folks who may not necessarily be the usual big tippers...but that wasn't the case. They were stellar. 

My manual wheelchair did sometimes struggle with the Westin's second floor carpeting, but for the most part I found every part of the facility pretty wheelchair friendly. I also watched for any signs that people were staring or being judgmental - I really didn't see it. 

The sidewalk around the Westin is in a little bit of disrepair, especially once you leave the Westin's entryway. While it's surrounded by some decent restaurants, and has a Shula's Steakhouse directly in it on the 2nd floor, those who tip easily might do well to take a companion if going beyond the facility. I will note that most of the crosswalks in this area are well-timed and many of them use audio for crossings. 

While I did not stay in a room, I did visit friends and found the accessible rooms to be truly accessible to varying degrees. You definitely need to communicate the need - and it's worth noting that the top 3 types of rooms (the most expensive) do not list having accessibility features. 

The Westin may not be the fanciest hotel in downtown Indy, but it's a solid option and convenient to most of what you'd want. It's also a terrific choice for disabled consumers from accessibility features to disability friendly staff. I definitely give it a thumbs up.",0.19372294372294374
Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia South at The Navy Yard,Philadelphia,1.0,"I stayed here on New Years Eve to go to Xfinity Live. The package I purchased from the hotel came with 2 tickets to the Xfinity event. After purchasing the package, I called the hotel to ask how I get my tickets- they told me they would have them for me the day of the event when I checked in. 
Flash forward to the day of the event... the hotel changed their story and said I should have received my tickets from Xfinity in an email. I had not. The lady I spoke to at the desk was very unsympathetic so I ended up spending a lot of time on the phone with Xfinity that day- this was in fact the hotels job though, not mine. But no one there seemed willing to help me. 
When I asked to speak to a manager, he was ALSO rude. He still claimed there was nothing they could have done about the situation. He didn't apologize for the 7 phone calls I had to make to Xfinity or for the rude employees at the desk. 

I would never stay here again or purchase any sort of package from Marriot.",0.020454545454545447
The Westin Philadelphia,Philadelphia,3.0,"We spent Valentine weekend here. I was delighted with the service and our room and had no complaints except for the dark haired bartender who was working Sat . early evening (around 6 PM).
The bartender never made eye contact with me. After standing in full view for at least 10 min, a couple of young women showed up to order drinks. The bartender immediately started taking their order. I spoke up politely and told him I had been waiting ahead of them. He looked my way and ignored me while taking care of the 2 women. He then went on to serve several other people before he served me. I have no idea what the issues were with this man , but he clearly shouldn't be working at a Westin. Being treated in
such a hostile manner has made me much less likely to stay at this Westin again.",0.03910256410256409
The Westin Indianapolis,Indianapolis,1.0,"Stayed here for 1 night and the hotel room was great, clean comfy bed, comfy pillow. However, the STARBUCKS at this location just ruined my entire experience at this hotel. They make it seem like it's a Starbuck but they really just serve coffee that is starbucks brand. It is unfortunate that this place has Starbucks ads and decoration because once you order you quickly realize this is a terrible terrible place. They wanted to charge me $10 for a breakfast sandwhich that is $5 at starbucks, when I told them I no longer wanted this (because for $10 I can get a much better breakfast) the staff quickly became rude and condescending. My husband went ahead and ordered his croissant which was stale and old.... again the staff was extremely rude... at this point I just wanted them to know something was wrong with the food, I didnt want my money back. The coffee grounds might be starbucks but everything else is not! As I was there I saw two other people leaving very upset as well. It is such a shame that this experience ruined our stay at the hotel.",-0.07324561403508772
The Westin Indianapolis,Indianapolis,1.0,"Terrible hotel management and an astounding lack of customer service. I booked two nights at this hotel and hoped to have a relaxing weekend with my spouse. This stay was going to be enhanced by my use of two Marriott Bonvoy Suite Rewards certificates to get us into a fantastic 2 bedroom/2 bath suite.
Unfortunately, even after I received an email confirmation that I had secured that exact room type and it was showing up in the Marriott app (and I do have a screenshot), the front desk staff attempted to cheat us by only putting us in a one bedroom suite. They even tried to tell my spouse that this was an upgrade from our original 2 bedroom/2 bath suite. Very deceptive and dishonest. The front desk staff was also very disrespectful to my spouse.
The only good thing is that I was able to cancel both nights during the day of checking without paying for either night. I have no idea whether Marriott Bonvoy will refund me my two Suite Rewards nights, however. I registered an issue with them,  but who knows what will happen.",0.10961538461538461
Residence Inn by Marriott Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,4.0,"We were in Philly for our first time and chose this hotel. The location was perfect to visit and site see. We were literally in the center of everything hence the ""center city"". Very clean and homey. It had a small kitchen with appliances including a good size refrigerator. We had a great view of city hall which I must say is a beautiful building. Overall a good experience.  During the week they have free breakfast and dinner small but nice for free.

My only complaint was one of the girls at the front not all just one was very rude. If you aren't a people person you most definitely shouldn't be working the front desk of a hotel that is frequented.

On the other hand the rest of the staff were friendly and helpful. Not sure if I'd stay there the next time I go back.",0.2114666666666667
Residence Inn by Marriott New Orleans Downtown,New Orleans,5.0,"Poo to the three stars reviews! 

I could be biased based on the fact that to even get a decent sized snuggle hole in Los Angeles, you have to empty out your bank account, but I left this hotel...well...not even wanting to leave. 

Please holla if any of the following amenities doth deserve any less than five stars (and if you do I might just pop you on the head).

-Full two-bedroom, two-bath suite with fully stocked kitchen and living room for $160 at Christmas time. The only thing less homey was the fact that our Christmas Tree consisted of a hibiscus with lights strung around it. 
-Full buffet style breakfast (i.e. stuff yourself silly you waffle and omelet monger, you!) every morning. 
-Fitness room with machines newer than your fancy ass gym and attached TVs. And flavored water coolers. If that doesn't make you want to work off that egg nogg then fine, stick with the Santa look!
-Basketball court, tennis court, & heated pool. Cause that's what you do when it's 70 degrees and muggy for the holidays. 
-Walking distance to the French Quarter, and drunken crawling distance to enough restaurants to get your legal bourbon consumption. But hey, what's legal in NoLa anyway? SHOW! ME! YOUR!.... oh wait... Mardi Gras is still a week away...
-Free drink nights and BBQs Monday-Wednesday every week. Seriously? 
-TV's in every room including HBO, etc. Not that you need to watch TV on vacation. Unless you're Veronica and proceed to get the stomach flu your last two days in town. At that point TV and pillows to hug while in the fetal position are CRUCIAL. That, and a toilet verry verrry close by. 

All in all, I couldn't think of one bad thing about this place. It may not look like much more than the dirty stepcousin of the big fancy Marriott down the street, but where fancy big Marriott might be your millionaire sugar daddy, Residence Inn is like your old rich uncle: and only one of those will make you waffles for breakfast every morning.",-0.004247685185185179

Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"They reopened this place just 3 months ago and they really need to work out some kinks.

I can see how the vision was grand and spectacular but somewhere between the vision and implementation the ball got dropped unfortunately. On the good side, the rooms are nice, lots of TV channels, the view from the gym and the Imperial room on floor 32 are incredible. The Imperial room itself is  great service, good food and drinks including a huge variety of alcohol. 

Someone once told me that ""being great starts with the details"". However the details are where the trouble begins. The sink looks great but has poor design and you end up spilling water. Water pressure is poor in the shower and you only get moderately warm water. Some of the employees are great but some are rude. The elevator needs a tutorial. It is cool that it is so advanced but I can people spending a lot of time trying to figure it out.

Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing,Philadelphia,4.0,"We were looking to stay in Downtown Philly for few nights. I saw that this Hilton had some consistent and great reviews. The location was perfect. It is right off the main highway, in a quiet and safe corner of the city and within walking distance to most tourist attractions. Valet parking is in front, while self-parking (a 6-floor indoor garage) is about a block ahead to the right. Parking was $35 per night but includes in/out privileges which is great. You submit your original paper ticket to the hotel desk at check-in and from then on, you use your hotel room card to enter and exit the parking lot. Once you park, you have to take a elevator don to the main garage floor, then walk a bit to the car rental area only to take another elevator up the lobby. Once there you have to take the normal elevators up to the room...so essentially, each time we left and re-entered the hotel, we had to take 3 separate elevators to get to our room. The lobby is big and lovely, especially being decorated for the holidays as it was. All staff were king, friendly and helpful. Check in was simple. We arrived there at about 1 PM and despite their normal 3 PM check-in time, they were able to get us a great NorthEast facing room overlooking the bridge and river. The room was on the smaller side, but probably average for city-hotels. The beds were very comfortable and the bathroom was very clean. The room was okay but I was expecting maybe a bit more modern touches such as more charging outlet strips and USB ports. Those minor details.upgrades can make a big impression. There was an ironing board, iron, safe, coffee/tea maker and hairdryer in the room. Ice-machines and vending ($4 20-oz. sodas) are located on each floor. Gym and pool were also available but we did not have an opportunity to use either. When reviewing hotels, it is good to look at the competitors...for example...it would be unfair to compare this hotel which is centrally located in a big city to something in the suburbs, which may offer perks such as free and convenient parking, free breakfast and microwaves in every room(they charge $25 if you want a microwave in your room). Understanding this, I can say we had a great stay here. There is a bar in the lobby (the day of the Cowboys-Eagles game) which was pretty live. There is also a restaurant down there as well as a pantry area for all of those essentials you forgot to bring. Across the highway (10 minute walk) is where you will find shopping/MArket Street with lots of food options and a CVS.",0.24864473304473303

DoubleTree Suites by Hilton Hotel Tucson - Williams Center,Tucson,1.0,"So we got a room under the impression this was a 3-4 star hotel based on trip advisor reviews. Obviously that is very misleading. This is not a typical doubletree by Hilton. Im a Hilton rewards member and travel often for work so Ive stayed in a lot of them. This looks like a motor lodge, ran like one too. Where do I start? First impression: homeless living at the back of  the parking lot just over the chain link fence. Theres a drainage ditch that has a large homeless city in it. We could see them and hear them while we were unloading our car. Super safe. And what a view out your window! Next. Our bathroom shower was gross. Had rust stains and mildew (see pics) and a large crack in the tub. Not inviting at all. The room itself was clean but this place needs a renovation badly. 
Only one of us got hot water in the shower. The other shower was lukewarm even after waiting 30 minutes between showers. Called the front desk and asked why there was no hot water and the guy said he would check on it and call us back. Never did. So my daughter skipped a shower and thats not ok after a 13 hour drive . How does a hotel not have enough hot water for 2 SHOWERS? Explain that to me?  Does this place have any management whatsoever? At 4am we were awoken by loud conversations outside. My husband got up to get something out of the car and there were guest (?) standing outside cussing and carrying on and a car pulled up. They exchanged something and were being very loud with the person in the car. I called the front desk and the woman named Godman answered. I asked if they have security in this place and she said they did but they had just left. I told her the situation and she very rudely yelled ""I'll call the police"" and hung up. She didn't want to be bothered obviously. With that we packed up and left. At 4:30am. We cut our night short to get the heck out of there. Not only is this place not safe, it's definitely not worth $140 for a room. This is a Motel 6 stay at best.

Four Points by Sheraton Philadelphia Northeast,Philadelphia,2.0,"As architect Louis Sullivan said, Form Follows Function."" Unfortunately, when Sheraton bought this property, which used to be a Doubletree Club Hotel, they ignored this lesson.  They renovated the room with flat-screen, widescreen TVs, but kept the ghostly analog signal.  They installed dysfunctional wall units with minimal drawer space and a too-small roll-out desk. They replaced the bathroom fixtures with hard-to-use alternatives, and they took out the Au Bon Pain, replacing it with an inferior offering.

Hyatt House New Orleans/Downtown,New Orleans,1.0,"I wish 0 stars was an option.  Don't waste your money here. I got an email that our room was ready. We pulled into the hotel and there was a sign that said ""valet parking full"", so we had to ask where to park. Next door, in a garage, which was packed!  It was a long walk to the front desk. We stood with a young (new, I think) girl, who looked confused. She asked for help from Beatrice, who stared at the computer for a VERY long time (4 other people checked in next to us while she was staring). I finally asked if there was a problem and she said, ""I can't find a queen room"" which was, indeed, reserved. That is ALL she said to me, until she swiped my card. Meanwhile, a manager was on the phone accommodating another upset guest who also did not get the guaranteed queen room. The manager gave her an upgrade to a king suite, $50 off AND points to her account. 
After Beatrice swiped my card she gave me the keys and I said, ""oh, you found my queen room?"" She said no. I asked why she charged me without talking to me. She then LIED TO MY FACE and said, ""I told you and I asked"". No, she didn't say a word. I then asked what she could do for their error and she said, ""well you have a bathtub"".  Great, maybe I could sleep there?  I told her I just heard the manager accommodate another guest and she said she couldn't do that. So I asked for a manager. She said, ""oh, you want a manager?  Fine.""  She came back with Angelique, a manager, who was nice and apologetic. When I told Angelique that Beatrice had not gotten my approval to run my card with the wrong room, Beatrice raised her voice and lied again. The manager had to put her hand on her arm to quiet her down. The manager then refunded me $50, but nothing else. 
Room was ok, reeked of coffee!  Super gross. We tried to return to our room after a concert and the elevator had a LONG wait and the fire exits in the stairwells were locked!!!  Super scary if an emergency had arisen.

Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,3.0,"Upon checking in I was impressed with the hotel.  It is very large, and upscale looking.  The girl that checked us in was very friendly and even though we couldn't check in early she upgraded our room to one with a balcony after I asked if there were any available.  We left our bags with the bellman and went out to get lunch. It was a quick walk to the French Quarter (maybe 10 minutes).  

When we got back we checked into our room with the promised balcony.  It was one floor above the pool area which at first I thought was pretty cool.  But, at 7pm when I tried to put my 2 year old to sleep the music was still loud outside and we could definitely hear it inside our room.  Needless to say, he didn't fall asleep until after the music stopped around 9pm.  If you are looking for a quite stay I would ask for a quite part of the hotel.  Around 12am some guests came back from their night out and went to the pool area and were extremely loud.  So, that woke us all up (including my 2 year old).  Again, its my own fault for asking for a patio, but I didn't think we would hear outside noise once the door was shut.  We were looking for a place to go after we put our son down without leaving the room and we couldn't afford a suite.  I wish the front desk girl would have warned us about the noise.  

The room itself was remodeled and nice.  The bathtub did not drain well though.  By the end of my shower I had tons of standing water.  One nice convience is that they offer things on loan that you might have forgotten.  I was able to borrow a straightening iron for my hair, which I thought was great!  They have a ton of great restaurants and bars inside the hotel and a starbucks!  Bonus!

Upon checkout I asked to speak to a manager and the girl wouldn't get one and instead just kept asking me what the issue was.  I said I just wanted to tell him my complaints before I posted them on yelp.  I was looking for anything, just wanted to let him know.  She said, ""would a $20 allowance"" be ok?  I said I was looking for anything, but I am not going to turn down a free $20.  I would have been content to just tell the manager my opinion.  This front desk girl was rude and short with me (complete opposite from check in).  Overall, I would stay here again, but I would ask for a quite room.",0.21725117975117977
Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,It was my first stay here and it did not start out great all. Booked about a month in advance and the day I arrive I check current rates for the room I booked and it dropped about $200 and I showed the people at the front desk. Multiple third party sites were listing rooms cheaper and I was getting told that I already locked it in an we don't know that site so after about 20-30 minutes I decided to just go ahead and check in. My stay for 2 nights was $700. Second issue was parking. They ONLY offer valet parking which is $40 a day. The valet directed us to a public parking structure right around the corner and told us that the parking garage (Premium Parking) SCAM connects to the hotel on the second level. We pull into the parking garage and a lady told us it will be $15 after we said we are staying at the Hotel. She said the Hotel will reimburse us when we check out. We brought it up with people at the front desk and they told us they are not affiliated with the parking garage at all even though it is connected to the Hotel by elevator and the sign in front of the parking garage says hotel on it. When we get ready to leave the parking attendant says the we owe another $38 dollars to get out. We had an issue with this because were not told this when we asked the lady in the first day we came to park. We tried talking to the attendant which was the most rudest and unprofessional attendant I've ever met starts yelling and cursing at us. I'm pretty sure he'd been drinking because he reeked of alcohol and was slurring his speech. My wife got out of the car and wanted to speak to his manager and he says that his manager is not in town. Him and my wife get into a heated argument and he slams his window down on her hand and calls the cops. An officer from New Orleans PD shows up and immediately gives off a vibe like you are wasting my time. I introduce myself and try to shake his hand but he is not interested. No professionalism whatsoever. My wife wants to file a complaint. Also she recorded the whole incident and showed the video to the cop. The cop walks over to the attendants office and immediately is friendly with him and appears to know or has had dealings with him before. After about 5 minutes of what looks like they are joking around he comes back over and his demeanor instantly changes back to the way it was before. He says that my wife could be charged with disturbing the peace and that we need to pay so the matter can be ended. So we do and leave. Definitely shady business practices going on at this location.

When I asked about a bulletin board in the lobby, I was told there wasn't one and then was assured that there wasn't one in the break room either. I walked out and could clearly see the bulletin board full of public events and places to go. I brought a few fliers back and asked if those were indeed ""public happenings."" While keeping someone on hold, He responded ""we don't take outside events."" I responded without any angry, ""thank you, that's a better answer."" He began to get very rude with me, saying.

Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing,Philadelphia,3.0,"Stayed here last weekend for a weekend. Overall a good experience. Easy Check-In and our room as great - clean, spacious, beautiful view. I also obviously spent time in the bridal suite, which was huge! And great space to get ready, hangout and take pictures. Not to mention it's on the penthouse. Heck yeah!!! 

The ballroom for the wedding was nice, as well. The space was beautifully decorated. I do wish the cocktail hour space was a tad bigger because it did feel quite crowded.  The food was wonderful! Great appetizer selection and the chicken entree was delicious. 

I knocked down two stars for one reason and one reason only - the bartenders were the most rude servers I've ever experienced in my life. It was a sin. I would NOT recommend this to others planning a wedding SOLELY because of that. It was the biggest buzzkill. I'm not the only one who felt this way either, everyone was annoyed. The waitstaff can transform a good experience to an absolute terrible one and vice versa...this was a great example of that...",0.32879549808429115

Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Tampa N - Busch Gardens Area,Tampa,2.0,"I'm astonished by all of the four and five star reviews of this place - it is mediocre at best. 
I'll echo the reviewer who said it was the noisiest hotel he's ever stayed in. I'm on my 3rd hour of listening to non-stop yelling and screaming from the pool, which is highly irritating and not conducive to either work or sleep.  The upper courtyard is some pseudo-tile surface (ie, hard), and the lower one is just all asphalt. The noise echos like crazy and the walls are thin. 

Morning check-in staff were borderline rude, though the woman on the evening shift was quite nice and helpful. Expect to wait for so-so food if you eat at the restaurant on site. 

Would definitely not recommend staying here, unless you have kids and and actually like the thought of having them join the screaming masses at the pool.",-0.07430555555555558

Hyatt Regency New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.

The elevators are extremely difficult for disabled guests to use: most have touch pads with no way for visually- or mobility-impaired users to access them.

The room itself had a terrible sewage-like smell.  When we requested resolution from the front desk, they suggested that this was our own fault because of trash in the room.  When we pointed out that our trash cans contained only paper, they sent an employee with scented spray to cover the smell but did not respond to our requests for a thorough cleaning, a new room, or at least an investigation of the scent.

Worst of all, when we went to check out, OUR BILL WAS WRONG BY MORE THAN $400.  The hotel attempted to ""rectify"" the situation through withdrawing a further $423.51 from my credit card without notifying me.  When I called to dispute the charge, a condescending and rude employee by the name of Frank tried to tell me that I had simply misinterpreted my bill and no error had ever been made.  He only admitted that the hotel had made a mistake -- one of over $400 -- when I was able to pull up a copy of the receipt and demonstrate to him that we were not charged the correct amount upon checkout.

If you have the enormous misfortune to stay here, CHECK YOUR CREDIT CARD STATEMENTS CAREFULLY.  This is the type of establishment that considers it acceptable to continue to pull hundreds of dollars from customers' accounts a week after they check out, without even the courtesy of a notification.  I shudder to think that they still have my credit card information on file, and will be keeping a careful eye on my statement going forward.",-0.08818181818181818
Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing,Philadelphia,1.0,"Gave my daughter some nights here as Christmas present. Experience almost ruined by their excessive incidentals fee: at 75$ per day it was almost as much as the room-yet completely unnecessary as all amenities are unavailable due to Covid. I covered this for my daughter too but felt outrageously ripped off. On top of this it was not possible to give them my card over the phone or let my daughter use it. I had to accompany her-a real inconvenience for me as I live far away-and be there while they swiped. So I felt ripped off AND put upon. The front desk employees were rude, didn't acknowledge the imposition of these policies. A glimmer of understanding for my position would have been nice. My daughter did enjoy her R&R but I was furious. I will never stay at a Hilton again. What I recommend?

Four Points by Sheraton Philadelphia Northeast,Philadelphia,1.0,"By far one of my worst stays at a hotel... I booked a reservation a couple days before and asked for adjoining rooms. During my reservation making I informed the rep that I would be coming to the hotel with my 12-year-old son and six of his cousins because it is my sons birthday and he wanted to go swimming. When I got to the hotel to do the check in, there was a convention going on and I was told by Ryan that I could not get an adjoining room and that the hotel has been booked for two days. But that the rooms were two rooms apart. But when Ryan gave me the key card the rooms were 505 and 511. So I said to Ryan these rooms are not two rooms apart, they are 5 to 6 rooms apart. I informed Ryan that the whole purpose of me making reservations and requesting two rooms connected  is because my 12-year-old son and his friends wanted to go swimming. Ryan informed me that this is not a party hotel and I asked him why wasn't that explain during the reservation making process. Ryan rudely told me that he could cancel the reservation and I explained to him that that was impossible because I had already planned everything.  So because I was not happy you're going to put me out of a hotel that I paid my hard earned money for!?!?  I proceeded to walk away from Ryan towards the elevators and go to my room Ryan in turn yelled at me and came up from behind the counter and told me that ""he was talking to me."" I responded with your not talking to me like that first of all you told me that I can get rooms adjoining and now you're telling me I can't get it and you're being rude can I speak to a manager.  Ryan told me ""No"" he was the manager.   He then proceeded to come from around the counter in a threatening manner like he was going to do something to me.  I walked away went upstairs to check on the rooms it when I came back downstairs to go to my car Ryan stopped me and apologized for his outburst and his action.  I said to him maybe you're under a lot of pressure he said yes but I'm thinking I'm a guest I have nothing to do with your pressure or stress level.   I was so annoyed  y his behavior I told him that I will be Yelping  him.  Later on that evening my son and his cousins down to the pool but we got to the pool supervisor Manny came in and advised us that everyone under 18 pass to get out of the pool.  I say wow this everybody in the pool OK no problem I told my nephews and my son to come out of the pool I have two nephews that were over 18 so I told them to stay.  Manny turn to my nephew and asked  how old he was my nephew he replied with 18 Manny then proceeded to question my nephew even more I explain to Manny that he didn't have to do that he didn't have to regulate my nephew I told him to get out of the pool and I will be taking him upstairs to the room.  He told me in an Extremely sarcastic way he was just doing his job that he does not make the rules. Then he proceeded to argue with me about kids in the pool, after I had already told the kids to get out. I told him I didn't like his tone and I would be  reporting him to corporate. He sarcastically asked me if I need a corporate's phone number I told him no I'm able to find it on my own.  I left the pool area with my nephews and we headed back up to our room for the rest of the night.  Around 10 o'clock I heard a knock at the door and it was Manny again this time telling me that the kid was running up the hall.  I said that's impossible but the kid has to walk down the hall because you guys did not give us adjoining rooms that we ask for in the beginning.  By now I was fed up with the treatment and rudeness of staff.  I called corporate and file the complaint and was offered 2000 points so bored hey stay for another time. I am form corporate but I didn't want any points because I would not be back at the establishment the treatment was horrible.  First I was holiday in front of other guests by the manager Ryan then I would talk to like I was trash by the supervisor Manny.  My claim number is 201804222167 I spoke with Tim and corporate on 4/21/18.

The Westin Philadelphia,Philadelphia,1.0,"I stayed at this hotel with my wife and young daughters on December 7, 2013.  I was there for a family wedding which took place at the hotel on Saturday night.  I arrived Saturday afternoon around 3:00 to find that my elderly and ailing parents were sitting in the lobby waiting for their room to get ready.  The hotel did nothing to expedite the process and they were very rude and bureaucratic.  I pressed the to let my parents get into a room and they reluctantly found something once pressed.  The wedding was fine.  The next morning I got up at around 7:30 and brought my young daughters out of the room to go to the lobby to get coffee.  Much to my surprise, all of the lobby furniture was removed from the lobby so there was nowhere to sit.  I asked why this was the case and they were vague and evasive about it.  I found a stool and sat in front of the fireplace with my daughters and had some coffee.  Turned out the Detroit Lions were staying in the hotel that night and were filing downstairs to go to breakfast.  Apparently when they stay at the hotel they require the hotel to remove all furniture from the hotel lobby so as to reduce gawking opportunities.  I could not have cared less about seeing them or talking to them - I just wanted to sit and drink my coffee and talk to my girls.  As I was sitting there a security guard came up to me and told me that if I said anything to any of the Detroit Lions I would be kicked out of the hotel - this was in front of my daughters.  I was very upset and angry but tried not to show it so as to avoid a confrontation.  Bottom line is that this hotel is badly managed and is not hospitable to its ordinary guests - they reserve their hospitality for obese ill mannered football players.  Previously I was a fan of Westin hotels generally but was appalled by the overall attitude of the staff and management and would never stay at this hotel or any Westin ever again if possible.

Residence Inn by Marriott Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"I was highly unimpressed with this hotel. The only good things that are worthy of any praise were the morning breakfast and the location of the hotel, which even the latter is a bit confusing! 

The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the lack of any welcoming into the hotel. The staff was cold and curt and did not make me feel appreciative for my business. When I later called them to make requests they were even more rude. Not too sure what I did wrong, but clearly I was not welcome here even though I am a Marriott Bonvoy member, and a loyal one at that.

I also did not like the layout of the room, and the bed itself. The bathroom sinks are literally outside of the bathroom, and the showers have only a half glass door. Basically they want me to live and step in my own bath water, how disgusting. The bed was also incredibly uncomfortable and the room gets uncomfortably hot at inopportune times.

The manager got upset, because she told me a rate and I asked if she could price match it because I seen it on the site for a cheaper rate. She became irate and upset then said why would I contest her rate. Which makes no sense because I've done this countless times, including at this location. As a business you shouldn't push customers away and get upset for having to do your job. Hotel is overpriced, if you're going to up charge at least make sure the customer service is A1.

The Westin Philadelphia,Philadelphia,4.0,"My stay started off rough, but turned into a delightful experience. I have never been treated as condescendingly or poorly as Paige at the front desk treated me. That scene in ""Crazy Rich Asians"" where the desk assistant was so rude was precisely how she treated me and my guest. We were amazed at her confidence in doing so. We almost walked out immediately. But, we stayed and made our way up to a beautiful room. I loved the room and the fun additions involving the constitution chair and Benjamin Franklin pillows. Those were lovely additions. I appreciate the eco friendly shampoo and conditioner containers in the bathrooms, although the body wash container was empty. The other issue in the bathroom was that the robes available (which looked amazing) were clearly used and dirty. They had stains all over them, which was pretty gross. The lobby is beautifully designed and a delightful place to spend time. We had a delicious breakfast at the hotel restaurant. The avocado toast was fabulous! I ordered it two days in a row.

Residence Inn by Marriott Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"This hotel stay was a 5 star stay until I  encountered valet. I'll cover the highlights first. 

My check in experience was pleasant. The staff was warm and helpful. They gave me great directions to a few local places and I always appreciate local insider suggestions. 

The room was clean and spacious. The couch and bed were comfortable and I had a great city view. 

Monday- Wednesday they offer an evening mixer on the 2nd floor. The appetizers are ample and 1 complimentary alcoholic beverage is provided as well. Breakfast is served in the same area daily. 

The location is superb. A grocery store is walking distance if you want to take advantage of the kitchenette. Otherwise, there are dozens of choices within a few blocks of the front door. 

Now, the valet...I didn't park here my first night. I'd already parked at a lot near a restaurant not far from the hotel and decided to leave the car there overnight and walk through the city instead. My second night, i pulled up to the valet area and lots of vehicles were already there. Seeing that it was busy, i expected to wait and had no problem with it. After about 7 minutes, the valet approached and asked if i was checking in. I said no. He responded by asking what am I trying to do. I respond that I'd like to park in valet. He repeats ""so you're checking in"" to which i again say no. He's rude and clearly irritated with me. He sighs and says ok, look, i have these 2 cars that need to be parked and a construction vehicle because they're doing work tonight and they're all ahead of you. I said, ok, what should i do? Should i come back or try to park elsewhere. I'm just trying to get to my room, so I'm ok either way. He tells me to wait here and walks off. 

Less than a minute later, a woman approaches my passenger side screaming. I let the window down and she continues screaming at me to move my car. I told her that valet just told me to wait here and he'd be back. She said ""I'm valet and I'm telling you to move now!"" Confused, i look around and see what my options are. There are cars in front of me and to my right. Traffic is on my left, so i can't immediately move. I scoot up a bit to show a good faith effort, but really have nowhere to go. Another minute later, the car in front of me moves and the male valet returns and says that he'll put my car somewhere. I asked was he going to park it or just put it somewhere. He said he needs to figure out where he can put it so it'll be a bit. I reply that i can park elsewhere if valet is full. He cuts me off and tells me that he'll take care of it. I say that I'll just go try to park at another place. He pulls out the valet tickets and tells me he'll give me a ticket and that i can't park anywhere else. I ask if other hotels are open for parking. He repeats that i have to park with him. I know this isn't true because i self parked 4 blocks away the night before. He continued to tell me in an aggressive manner that i had to park with him. I said that I'll just try to park on my own and before i could finish the sentence he slammed my door and walked off.

The Westin Tampa Waterside,Tampa,1.0,"My girlfriend and I stayed here in room 115 from 8/11/18 - 8/12/18.  It was a nice room and aside from the excessive noise in the hallway at 6am from other guests that made it impossible to sleep, the only problem with this establishment is the staff. 

When we arrived, tired from the 4 hour drive from Jacksonville but excited for the concert we were attending, we found ourselves at the front desk checking in with the only employee available. It was roughly 7pm on 8/11/18 (hoping management is reading this). The caucasian man behind the desk immediately had an attitude like we had inconvenienced him by being guests and offered rude comments such as ""looks like you're tardy to the party"" when he learned we were attending the concert at Amalie Arena. Even though we were obviously uncomfortable, he continued making snide and insulting comments through the entire check in process. Had I not been with my girlfriend and running late for the show, I would have demanded to speak to the manager about this raunchy staff member and asked for my money back because it really was that bad. 

When we were leaving the next day, we checked out with an employee that was actually courteous. However, when we got to the valet desk downstairs and waited 20 minutes for our car, we were loudly informed that ""our card was declined"" so everyone outside could hear (and looked at us) and were asked to make our way all the way back upstairs to the checkout desk. When we arrived again at the checkout desk with all of our luggage, we were immediately informed that there was no problem and to please go back downstairs.. Upon lugging our bags back downstairs, we saw the man who initially gave us this runaround and after he made eye contact with us, he hurried into an employee only door so as to avoid us. After another 15 minutes, we finally received our car (by the way, there is no self-parking so you will be required to valet park your car for $30 plus tip).

The Westin Philadelphia,Philadelphia,1.0,"Room broken into at Westin Philadelphia - AVOID THIS HOTEL!

My boyfriend and I stayed at the Westin Philadelphia the weekend after Christmas for two nights, and our room was broken into (room 802, next to the elevators). We realized it a couple hours after we returned to our room that day after receiving a notification from my credit card company that my card had been used at a few stores in the area. I hadn't actually taken that credit card out of the hotel room at any point, so we checked through the rest of our stuff and realized that my boyfriend's laptop had also been taken.

I am shocked at how the Westin staff and Marriott corporate has handled this situation over the last month. At no time has the fact that our room was broken into actually been addressed. It took weeks of follow-ups, phone calls, and emails to get any kind of response from anyone, which was ultimately that they will not be able to help us.

We immediately reported the theft to the hotel staff, and after about 15-20 minutes, a security officer and the Assistant Front Desk Manager, Christopher Fries, came to our room to take a report. He let us know that we could speak further with Karim Ware, the Director of Guest Services, the next morning. Throughout our entire experience with Karim, he was flippant and unprofessional, and clearly had no interest in, concern about or sense of urgency with this entire situation. Each time we followed up with him for an update, we were told that he would be getting in touch with us after a few more days. Each time, we didn't hear back from him so we again had to follow up. The responses were always a one or two-sentence e-mail:

""My apologies we should and will get back to you this week as we are still investigating this matter""   

We were also told that Westin would be conducting their own investigation into what happened, and although we've asked multiple times for the outcome of this investigation and for surveillance footage, our requests were ignored. I also emailed Marriott corporate about this, and about two weeks later I received a response from Debra Camperud, a Corporate Liaison of Consumer Affairs, with the frankly laughable excuse that the hotel is simply not responsible for thefts, and that was it. Again, my request to have the outcome of their investigation was completely ignored. 

The morning after the incident, Karim said that he ran a report of the electronic key card activity for our room and that our door was actually left open while we were out. I find this extremely difficult to believe. I work in the travel industry and travel quite often through the US and South America, and it is engrained in my travel habits (especially in cities) to close the door tightly behind me. We also were sure to place the Do Not Disturb sign on the door before we left, because we didn't want housekeeping to enter, and since a housekeeper was right outside our door when we left, we checked the sign and the door again before leaving. Karim also told us our door was ajar again later in the evening, when we were in the room and had already called security to report the theft. I was there looking at the closed door waiting for them to arrive, so if the door was ajar, it is very obviously a problem with the door not functioning properly. Chris, the first manager, also commented to us that our door, when closed, seemed off - like there was more of a gap in the door than there should be. 

I can only assume at this point that this was an inside job, that an employee of the Westin knows that their doors are faulty and took advantage. You need a key to get to the 8th floor, and what's more interesting is that my credit card was taken out of my wallet and the laptop was taken out of a bag, and both were closed back up and put back where they were. Whoever did it clearly wanted to be very subtle and didn't want us to immediately notice that anything was missing. I don't know if the staff at Westin is trying to protect someone or what, but the complete lack of concern on Karim and Debra's part is just unbelievable. 

I regularly used Marriott hotels for my own clients, and I can say that from now on I will no longer be recommending them. I can't recommend this company in good conscience since I would never want my clients to experience the lack of care that I did. 

If you're traveling with anything of value, a woman traveling alone, or traveling with kids or the elderly, I would be extremely careful at this property.",0.024278499278499274

So my wife is a long time Hilton point earner. She called her Hilton rep and she was instructed to book through Expedia, since Hilton had no rooms left.  
Expedia It is I guess. She finds a room named KING Evolution . Wen we got to our room it was NOT a suite... this room was booked based on the pictures. Luckily the front desk employee Anthony was nice enough to move up to a suite. At no extra charge. He explained that Expedia has the wrong pictures.

The Westin Indianapolis,Indianapolis,2.0,"Ohhh Indianapolis....will I ever find a decent hotel in your city?!

My fiancé and I were in town for a pre-season NFL game, and decided to make a night of it and stay in Indy rather than making the 3 hour drive back home. We have had terrible experiences with hotels of lesser stature in Indy. We decided that we should try an upgraded property than what we had tried before....and what a waste of money that was!  Upon checking in (I think I recall Abby was the name of the front desk associate that checked us in) we had asked about parking as we had used spot hero, instead of telling us what their valet prices were and having us bring up our car to park with them, we got a ""I dunno, that's not our garage"". (ended up have to pay $55 for the 12 hours we were in the garage extra!)Then we asked for directions for the mall so we could buy swim suits to try and enjoy the pool and hot tub, as we had already done 8+ miles of walking. Those directions were incorrect, as you can not take the sky walk to the mall, A really nice African American male server came out of the restaurant because he saw us looking lost. He greeted us with a much more enthusiastic and genuine greeting than the front desk, and wanted to help us. He first asked us if we would like to dine in tonight and hear more info about the restaurant. We let him know we were trying to make it to the mall. He gave us perfect directions, even which door was the easiest to leave the hotel and which entrance to go in at the mall. I wish I had this mans name, because he was exactly what I would have expected in this kind of hotel. He deserves recognition! After walking to circle centre mall and walking back, we managed to have 2 hours of swim time left. We changed into our suits and headed down to the pool, where our keys of course stopped working. When we finally got in, there were only a handful of other guests there. Which I at first was excited about.....then I figured out why. The chemicals in the hot tub were so harsh my eyes instantly when bloodshot and stung like I had sprayed bleach into them. The pool was no better, I broke out in hives within 20 mins.  We went back up stairs to try and order some beers to the room, (after telling the front desk when we first checked in that our phone AND tv were not working. and they said they were working on it)  So my fiancé goes all the way back down to the front desk to get yet another ""ohh I dunno, gee golly"" shrug, and ""we know it's an issue....can't do anything about it...what do you want"". He finally goads them into taking his order at the desk. He orders $80 worth of beer....at hotel prices that's not much. When they arrived the room service attendant was rude and short about the tray being heavy, I was trying to take the tray as my fiancé was changing inside! He managed to get shorts on just in time for this guy to come barreling into the room with our beer to flop it on our bed, which came with NO ICE in the buckets! That's a $10 tip I am aggravated I scribbled out in haste.  I get into the shower to try wash the chemicals off and soothe my hives, alas...we have NO SOAP  in our room. Remember this was  last minute stay, so I had no toiletries with me. Luckily I found something in my fiancé's  emergency bag in his car that he had brought in, including eyewash because my eyes still were unbearable. I come out of the shower hoping to relax with a beer while we go over the room service menu...all the Budweiser  twist off tops....are rusted on. Having to pry then off with a bottle cap was unappetizing as there was rust all over, so I settled for one of he coronas we ordered and water. More money absolutely wasted. All the door dash delivery places near the hotel were at 45 min delivery times at 10:30, so we decided to give room service a chance to redeem themselves.  What idiotic rationale. We called down at 10:55....the food was somehow cooked and rushed to our room by 11:13. (yes I know...I am that jerk. But a 3 star and above hotel on a weekend, especially one that is next to a convention center, and within a mile radius  NFL stadium, and MLB park in  downtown area of a city should be well prepared for) We had to use my cell phone to call down to the front desk, we ordered a medium burger, a medium rare steak with frites and asparagus. The burger was still hemorrhaging blood. The steak was tough, blue and had no traces of seasoning. The fries were cold and stale. The asparagus was still hard and cold. I understand it is frustrating when guests order late, but if you don't want to deliver edible food, say no orders after 10:30. Especially when the order is nearing $100. Being an Ohio girl, I have never not eaten steak that was sat down in front of me ever in my life. I took one bite and nearly choked, even adding on bottle of A1 couldn't give this any flavor.

What stood out the most to me? The hair in the shower before I used it and mold throughout the tile grout.

What I really thought of this place? It's gross. This hotel is so dated in obvious places. If you look carefully at the pictures on the hotel website, you'll notice that they left out the bathroom which is tiny as hell. This hotel definitely did not meet my expectations.

Check-in - The male who worked the desk upon my arrival on Friday, June 18, 2021, after 11 pm was rude. I asked a question and his response was condescending several times. Also, he casually mentioned that rooms at this place are $219/per night.

The overall facility is very outdated.

Did the room match what I saw in the pictures online? Hell no. The room I stayed in is very outdated, wasn't properly cleaned as the shower area needs to be remodeled. The hotel room overall was not properly cleaned. So much for the ""CleanStay"" sticker posted inside the room on the mirror.

Check out - The male who checked me out on Sunday, June 20, 2021, just before 11 am barely parted his lips to reply back to my hello to him. Also, he never asked how my stay was. This is one run-down hotel. Travelers, you can do so much better than this place.",-0.028750000000000015

I'll start with the good portion of our stay-we were upgraded to their director's suit-possibly due to the fact that we are Marriott rewards/Platinum Express  members-a very nice gesture we greatly  appreciated.  
We attended the Cowboys game which started at 1 and finished around 4:15-since we brought our dogs, the hotel staff allowed a very late check out with no extra charge-an absolutely wonderful accommodation and on top of that, Westins require no pet deposit.
A majority of the staff were very friendly and courteous.
The bad aspect of our stay-we encountered 2 hotel staff that were extremely rude over the phone-short and blunt/terrible communicators with a severe lack of manners. 
Heads up: the parking situation is terrible. Due to the fact that we have larger tires on our vehicle, we could not use valet, which was not a big deal, except for the fact that self parking was a complete nightmare. Initially, we were told three different things - first we were told that it was just a $40 overnight charge, then we were told it was a $40 charge plus an hourly rate during the day, and finally,  we were told that it was just a $40 fee overnight unless you have to take your car out during the day in which you were then charged hourly, which happened to be the correct rule ( this rule was not plainly written anywhere - we found this out after we checked out). So all in all, we ended up spending $80 in parking for just an overnight stay simply because we had to take our car out of the parking garage ONCE and because valet was not available to us.

Front desk treated us like drifters that were looking to skip out on the bill. Used a Visa to secure & pay for reservation OR SO I THOUGHT! Checked in at 1:30a after a 7 hr flight, the antiquated cc machine would not accept my Visa card despite Hilton confirming & reassuring (on multiple times prior to trip) that my room/reservation was paid for and secure. 

Durand at FD couldn't be bothered from night audit to help or give any service just stood and did his paperwork. He couldn't even be bothered to give the ""standard check-in script"" (breakfast, water bottles, location of room or even room #...nothing). Barely spoke. 

At 2:15a, frustrated & exhausted, I finally got into my room. 

7am Rebecca( FD Mgr) is calling me to kick me & my son out. Went down to FD w CC to run it again with hope of empathy and better customer service. WRONG! I even called Visa on speaker to verify funds in front of her and she still rejected my card. She then FOLLOWED me upstairs & FOLLOWED me into my room w/o permission like I was shoplifting!

She woke my son up but stood arms-crossed in my room waiting to ""watch me/us pack"".

Otherwise it is super outdated rundown hotel. Only one elevator was working for the 9 floor hotel. The front desk staff ignored me while attempting to check in. One girl was helping someone while 3 others pretended I was not there. Then I had to ask about parking and check out time. There was zero customer service. They said parking was free on weekends but charged us anyway. 
We got to our room and every drawer and the closet was open making the place look ransacked. We questioned the cleanliness and there was not a fridge. Now I am reading I could have requested one be brought to the room but was not even told about this service. This is a disgrace to Marriott and spg members standards.",0.22222222222222218
Crowne Plaza Philadelphia West,Philadelphia,1.0,"The entrance was full of gum and trash on the drive/loading zone. The lobby was filthy. Needed sweeping, vacuuming, and attention. A service person at the front desk saw me struggling with my luggage and just smirked at me. I always wipe the bathroom floor and check the tub/shower. I was easily disappointed to find a filthy floor and hair in the tub. I wiped up the floor twice with washcloths. Disgusting. Smelled of urine all around the toilet. Two of the bath towels had obviously been used and put back on the shelf as if clean. Just ew! The staff takes absolutely no pride in this place. Too bad because the beds were very comfortable. At 7:25 in the morning someone was jackhammering in the stairwell. It did not stop. Just not cool at all. After a very long day driving, we were looking forward to a good rest. That was plain rude. So happy to leave. TIP: pour shampoo on bathroom floors before you leave so the maids HAVE to wash the floor. I've done this for years. I took photos but will post later.

Tucson Marriott University Park,Tucson,4.0,"Checked in around 9 pm Friday July 17th and was very impressed by every aspect of the hotel. Great curb appeal, good parking and friendly attendants. The gentlemen at the front desk was very friendly and professional. Surprisingly clean rooms for what one usually finds on a college campus. I was very excited that we had a nice little balcony too! 

Only downside is not the fault of the hotel, but the walls are ridiculously thin and after the bars closed my fiance and I were rudely awakened by our neighbors. Unfortunately the kids were smart enough to quite down when security walked by, but immediately started back up again once the coast was clear.

Thankfully Charles at the front desk handled the situation amazingly well and promptly switched our room and offered complimentary breakfast. We will definitely be returning and recommending to others!",0.17462590939153436
Homewood Suites by Hilton New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"This place is nice to the eye, but staying here was definitely the worst part of my trip....the rooms are clean, the workers are rude....did not see the whole ""southern hospitality""that was talked about so much....the workers were inconsistent with what they said to my group when it came to how many people our king suites sleep...one woman said maximum five..and the same woman the next day maximum seven....then the manager said the amount of people didnt matter price wise after 4 people......

Because of their poor sense of good customer service...we decided to threaten to switch hotels which meant theyre out at least 1000 dollars for the weekend....and they didnt care...not even a fight...for a hotel that didn't seem to have a lot of people staying already....good thing we found a hotel first before we threatened to check out.....so we will be staying at the hilton down the street where they were so genuine and nice....

Hilton Tucson East,Tucson,2.0,"Wow. I've stayed at a bunch of hotels lately. This one had quite a few things going for it. For Tucson, this place is pretty nice. Looks good from the outside, has A/C, and a nice looking pool.

Hotel- Like I said, It's exterior is very nice. Modern with a slight twist of bed rock in the front lawn area. Glass centered elevator reminded me of being back in Downtown LA  again. Front desk lady was nice and helpful. It was 105 last weekend when we drove in and she saw and gave us water immediately. Did we look like crap, or just being nice? Probably just being nice. 

Room- Clean and good sized. I paid 125 for it with 2 beds for my brother and I. Quiet place with the doors on the inside, clean carpeting, looking good. Bed was nice as were the pillows, big and fluffy, my favorite, with no void in the middle of the bed. For the price I was thinking it should've had a refridge and micro in though. Bathroom was clean, One thing, It had no fan in the bathroom, so when we showered it turned into the freakin' Rainforrest in there after 5 minutes, weaksauce. 

Amenities-2 bottles of water that were in the room were 10 bux??? Dang, those should be free, am I in Beverly hills again? Darn GPS. Went to the bar for a pre dinner drink with my cousin who lives in Tucson, and the bartender/server was very rude to us. We tried to make small talk about the happenings of the city for the night and she totally dismissed us, we weren't rude or anything, and my cousin had to ask someone else to get his beer!! Strike 1. Here comes strike 2. The next morning we went downstairs to partake in their restaurant, seriously, some of the worst food I had all weekend. It was 30 bucks for the 2 of us, ouch, for breakfast. The potatoes were really sour. We mentioned to the server and got hashbrowns instead. She also brought me out brunt toast, this was funny because when I looked at the toast, she immediately asked if i wanted some new ones, If she knew this, why would she bring them out to me in the first place???? It took longer to get new un-burnt toast than the new hasbrowns, go figure. The restaurant has some problems. Don't bother, over priced Denny's food.",0.13524621212121218

Nice racket.

The elevators were scary.

The people in the restaurant were rude.  It was bothersome if you placed an order for food.  Literally.  We had placed a to-go order for bagels and the girl was huffy.  Someone else came in and asked how she was doing, and she said, ""I'd be fine if people didn't bug me to get stuff.""  Uh...isn't that her job as a waitress?",0.1111111111111111

2. The gym has nice equipment but no way to clean off your machine before/after sweating all over it. We have to hope that the staff is cleaning the machines at least once a day, god I hope so.
3. Don't bring food into the lobby bar. They'll yell the crap out of you and be really really really mean about it. Jerks. I'm so angry about it! Racist possibly.
4. Compared to the Boston Marriott, who emailed us before we arrived and gave us pro tips about the hotel, this one is awful on customer service. Not nice at all.

Hilton Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,2.0,"The first thing I do every time I get into my hotel room is check under the bed... so what did I find under the bed here?? A bottle cap, some popcorn, a bunch of crumbs, and a CONDOM WRAPPER. I mean, at least I only found a condom wrapper, unlike another review of this place that found used condoms. A condom wrapper isn't that bad, but it's the fact that they obviously don't bother to sweep anything out from underneath the bed or vacuum under there. I get it, it's under the bed, but that's still gross that it's not being cleaned at all! This is probably the dirtiest I've ever seen under the bed in a hotel.

The carpet also had a couple of large stains on it. The bathroom, towels, and bedding seemed to be pretty clean to me though. I was worried about bed bugs from a previous review but luckily didn't see any. 

The room size was pretty decent. The one I stayed in had two full size beds, a pretty big TV, a mini fridge, and a coffee maker (I really don't recommend using coffee makers at hotels though lol). The bathroom was a decent size, a little bigger than most bathrooms in hotels I've stayed at. The weird thing is how long the sink is... I'm 5' 2"" and the sink was lower than my hips. The decor seems to be a little old and outdated.

The hotel had a restaurant/bar and I came to order food (to go) with my colleagues about an hour before they closed. It took us about five minutes for someone to show up to the bar and take our order and when someone finally did, she obviously wasn't thrilled to have customers. I wouldn't say she was rude, but her demeanor wasn't pleasant and you could really tell she was annoyed that she had to wait on us. The front desk was pretty nice though.

They have a complimentary shuttle that runs every 30 minutes. I also heard the shuttle driver saying something about how they will drop you off at a couple other places, including a mall.

Wasn't a terrible experience, but I wasn't impressed or anything. I guess just turned off about the stuff under the bed... with everything under there, it makes me wonder when they cleaned it last.",0.07144209956709957
"Chateau LeMoyne - French Quarter, A Holiday Inn Hotel",New Orleans,1.0,"My husband and I checked in the Holiday Inn French Quarter-Chateau Lemoyne at 301 Duphine St. New Orleans LA 70112 9/22/2016 and checked out the morning at 09/25/2016. I left some of my clothing in the dresser drawer of the room. To check on my clothes I made a phone call to (504-581-1303) on 09/26/2016 at 6:30 in morning to the Holiday Inn and the manager at the front desk told me the room already was occupied so they could not check out the room for me.   I call the front desk again and the same lady answered the phone at 6:40. After I requested to confirm the room was occupied, she told me that the room actually was empty. I told her I could come over to pick up my clothes. However, she said I could not check out the room because of the company policy. Then she told that they had nobody can check it out for me. My flight was at 9:30am to Phoenix, so I asked for a security or a bell service person go with me to the room but she rejected this. She insisted I have to wait for the room service at 8am. I wanted to speak to her manager, and she told me she is the manager. Then I asked her name, and she told me she does not have to tell me her name. Thus I left a voice mail to the Lost and Found at 6:50. I waited until 8:10am and called the Holiday Inn, and the same lady answered the phone. She said the Lost and Found had not arrived. And she denied she told me that the Lost and Found would be at work at 8am. Thus I left the second voice mail to Lost and Found. After I came back to Phoenix, I called the Holiday Inn at 504-581-1303 at 9:50am, the front desk passed me to Lost and Found, but still nobody answered the phone. I left the third message. Then I required talking to the hotel manager, the front desk passed me to the manger's voice mail.  By 10:10am I did not hear anybody from the hotel, and I called the hotel again asked to talk to their manager but the front desk passed me direct to the Lost and Found. Still nobody answered the phone; I left the fourth voice mail. Later when I called the hotel I could only reach the answering machine and nobody answer my call anymore.  I called the Holiday Inn headquarter to make a complaint. The lady named Mele helped to contact the Holiday Inn French Quarter-Chateau Lemoyne and she gave me the case number 108269530. However, as of 1pm today 9/28/2016still nobody from the Holiday Inn French Quarter-Chateau Lemoyne has called me about this case.

Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"With a SMILE on my face, I walked to the check in desk. I was met by Farina where everything took a turn for the WORST. Farina spoke disrespectfully towards me, treated me as if I was UNWELCOME, and talked down to me. A small mix-up with the room reservation on Sheratons part, could have all been fixed had Farina been professional, respectful and smiled. Instead she accused me of saying I was guaranteed a suite and called Laura the front desk manager who I had confirmed my reservation through email with. I was placed into a suite at a cost of $80 extra on my part per night because sheraton didn't have my original reserved room available. The suite had no working AC, two large fans on high, and the hotel only had ONE working elevator the entire duration of my weekend stay.

Homewood Suites by Hilton New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"I can honestly say I've experienced better customer service at a DMV than at this establishment. 

There was a misunderstanding regarding payment. On our second day there, we arrived back to the room to find ourselves locked out of our suite. When we came back down to the lobby, DENISE at the front desk pointed at our party and said scathingly ""YOU! Come here"" and beckoned us to the desk with her index finger like we were schoolchildren. She then proceeded to rudely tell us that she was reprimanded by her manager for allowing us to stay in the room when it was unpaid for, then blamed US for ""getting her into trouble.""   OBVIOUSLY we were going to pay for our room, we had 7 ppl's personal belongings in there all day! Yet they felt the need to lock us out, then speak to us like we were complete trash.

From the mgr, we received NOT ONE apology for Denise's rude behavior. When told that we'd decided to check out IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR STAY for another hotel, the manager STILL did not apologize ONCE, nor did she try to maintain our business.

We knew we had had it when we went to the desk one more time on our final few hours there. Denise saw us standing on line to the desk, rolled her eyes, and said loudly to the other employee ""Can you see what THESE PEOPLE want?"" 

We ended up going to the HILTON ST CHARLES down the street, which turned out to be the same price, and whose employees I can't speak any more highly of. They were so courteous and professional and went out of their way to make sure we had a seamless remainder of our stay.

The bad. The seat of our toilet was broken and It was the LOUDEST toilet I have ever heard. The AC unit was also so loud every time it kicked on it woke me up. BUt all in all a good hotel that was close enough to everything even for a couch potato. Sadly the pool was out of order and the one that they offered would not really work for us since it was raining. So that was a disappointment. 

Now for the one person that was not nice. I have found that the concierge's job is to do their research and make friends with the companies in the area to get the best deals for those staying at the hotel. Well she told us she could get us a great deal on a swamp tour. When I asked her what kind of deal she said that she would just tell them my kids were small.. What? My kids are in their late teens and when I told her that she said that even if they noticed they would not say anything. I told her I did not feel comfortable lying she said sorry and that was that..

The staff was professional and responded quickly to our requests.  We requested a refrigerator and received one in minutes.  This was greatly appreciated because the next hotel that we were going to on our two week vacation was going to charge $15 a day for a fridge.  I must commend Brittany who worked the front desk, a valet named Richard and a young man from the maintenance staff who brought our fridge.   They were unbelievable! The only negative was a bellman named Robert who was rude and passed his duties onto the valet staff.  Aside from this, our stays were great.  Being one block from Bourbon Street was great. I gave the hotel four stars because the restaurant was only open in the morning.  When I called the front desk about the hours, Brittany referred me to several places that delivered.

Our first room was fairly clean except for some stains on the carpet then we realized the toilet wasn't working.  I called the front desk and asked if they could send someone to look at the toilet. The lady started off nice and told me their ""engineer"" had already left for the weekend and they would add our issue to the list of stuff for him to look at Monday afternoon. I expressed my concern about the toilet overflowing in the middle of the night and said I just needed a plunger and I could take care of it myself.  She started to get rude and told me that the staff did not have access to any of the ""engineering tools"" and nothing could be done. I asked her if they could switch us to another room and she finally agreed to do so. When I went to get the new key card and she wasn't happy with me. I even said I was sorry for the trouble but that didn't help. 

The second room had a working toilet but there were even more stains on the carpet. There were tiny ants in the bathroom and on the cabinet in the main part of the room. The a/c was running and cooling a little bit when we first got in the room but as the night went on the room got hotter and hotter. We had already switched rooms once, had two young kids with us and had to get up at 3:30 am for our flight so we didn't want to mess with trying to get another room. 

When we got ready to leave the hotel we went downstairs to take the shuttle to the airport. When we checked-in we asked what time the shuttle ran and they told us it did not start until 5 AM. We really needed to leave earlier than that and were told we had to pay for our own taxi. We decided the 5 am time was fine but when we got down there ten minutes early, there were already three people waiting before us and four flight attendants. The hotel only had a small van as a shuttle and told us that flight crew got to leave first since they had to leave for work. They had called a car service to come get the rest of us. Some people that came downstairs later had to wait for another car to pick them up. 

Because the staff wasn't the most helpful, my husband contacted corporate and complained. They were a lot more helpful than anyone at the hotel that we dealt with.",0.10125954668637598
Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"Do NOT stay here. 

I chose to stay here because other Starwood hotels were booked up for the Florida Bar Exam. My 2 night stay was an absolute nightmare. 

On the first day, after checking in, I was told they were out of the rooms that I had specifically requested. (1 king, due to the size of the desk and study space) Instead they gave me a smaller room, with a tv stand/ catch all with a chair in front. 

The shower was clogged up with someone else's hair, and when I went to take a shower, the hair over flowed back into the tub. Furthermore, there were sugar ants on the bathroom countertop. 

Thinking I'd be able to relax before my exam the next day, I tried turning on the TV. Nothing... Both the TV and the alarm clock radio were broken. 

I reported the shower, ants, TV, and alarm clock to the front desk that night. 

After returning from the first day of my exam, none of the problems had been fixed. 

This time I went down and spoke to the manager, Raquel Mares, who said it was the first she heard of the problems, and she was sending engineering up to fix it. 

It took 2hrs for them to come up and look at the problems. I had went down to a local coffee shop to find a place to study for the next day's exam. 

When I came back at 10pm, the valet guy was asleep on the bench and I had to park my car in the valet garage myself (no big deal, however, this hotel only has valet parking and charges for it)

 NOTHING was fixed. The only difference I saw was the ""engineer"" had removed the drain plug from the shower. But, there was still hair in the drain backing up into the tub. And ants on the counter. 

I called it in a third time. By the time I came back from the exam on the second day, nothing had been fixed at all. 

I never had a decent hot shower, I became friends with the ants, and I just chalked it up to bad service.

When I spoke to the manager (Mares again), she had acted like I was making up all of these problems, even though I had shown her pictures.  She begrudgingly offered me a few dollars off and 1000 Starwood points ( which is appx. $10). But a week later, I noticed that not only was I having to pay the full price, they overcharged me!

Holiday Inn Philadelphia Historic District,Philadelphia,1.0,"Terrible - vomit in room, no wi-fi, awful service, overpriced

This was one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. We arrived and had a double bed, and I tried to nicely ask for King or Queen room. They turned us down, coming up with various excuses but clearly lying. :/ We booked on priceline so no biggie that we couldn't switch, but don't lie! They could have just said we got the cheap rate and that they couldn't give us a Queen or King. Instead they chose to lie - which was apparent because I got a different answer from the two people i spoke with, both of whom were very rude and seemed to think I was being very difficult for having a request.

But the worst part was that the room had a terrible odor. I reported it but they seemed to think I was a picky customer or something and kept telling me to come back when they were less busy, after 3, etc. Finally I discovered that one of the beds had not been properly cleaned and that there was vomit on it. I begged someone to come and look and a lobby attendant came. She was horrified, said no one should ever have to go through this. She asked me to call the front desk and explain that this was a serious issue and they'd need more than standard cleaning or I'd have to get a new room. They didn't seem to want to listen to me so finally the lobby attendant got on the phone. A manager arrived who asked why we didn't report it sooner (we tried!). It was our second day and I just couldn't take the smell anymore! Once I discovered the source of the smell (we were only using one of the beds, thankfully not the vomit one), I had to TELL THEM TO GET SOMEONE UP TO SEE THIS. Finally, the manager gave us keys to a new room and left, clearly disgusted (it was so gross!) but NEVER APOLOGIZING for our inconvenience.

The lobby attendant was the only nice, apologetic and helpful person in the entire hotel. She should run the place :). 

Oh, and they say they have free wi-fi but it didn't work the entire time. We were there for 2 days on a prime tourist weekend.

However I do not think that personally bashing a front desk staff on Social Media is appropriate or professional.

*** Comfortable bed.  
*** Friendly staff.  Our room was nicely made up every day
*** Convenient location.   ( You can easily walk to the French Quarter, but bring comfortable walking shoes!)

To start with, this is a pricey hotel, considering it's a Holiday Inn. But it's the French Quarter so I was ready to forgive that. 

I got in my room and it smelled a little musty but I didn't think too much of it since I would only be spending one night. It was a weird room with floor to ceiling windows overlooking the outdoor hallway. Very strange. Anyway, there are curtains, and it's only one night, so I didn't worry about it. 

I left the hotel to go have dinner and see a comedy show and returned to my room around midnight.

Then around 3:00 AM I woke up with a terrible coughing fit, was having trouble breathing, and the smell was overwhelming. Now, I'm not a sensitive or allergenic person, so for it to have that affect on me, it must be something bad. The only think I can figure is it must be mold. I called the front desk and he quite brusquely told me there were no more King size rooms. I told him I didn't care, I just needed a different room because I couldn't breathe. I let him know I was already repacked and would be down there in 3 minutes to change rooms, and told him he may want to leave a note for maintenance to look at the room. No response from him.

I walked to the front desk and he slid a new key folder across the counter. He didn't acknowledge my presence in any other way, including making eye contact or apologizing for the problem.

The lady on the phone was extremely rude and I could tell that my phone call was an extreme inconvenience to her, as was sending the driver. I shrugged that off to someone having a bad day. Completely unnecessary to treat a guest that way though! The driver came and he was wonderful!! Very polite and gave me suggestions for things to do & places to eat in the area. 

When I made the reservation about 5 months prior I called to be sure that the shuttle went to the convention center. The front desk person (I assume) who answered asked me if my stay was for a specific (and VERY large) conference that was in town for the weekend. She told me that they would shuttle us just to and from the center. GREAT! Booked it!

After checking in I called down and ask for the shuttle when I was informed the indeed did NOT provide that service for anything above ""2-3 miles"". Clear cut, huh?

So $200 in cab fares later for the weekend I was frustrated but again, trying to chalk it up to someone possibly being new, or maybe that was the plan and then they realized that the conference was so large and decided against it? Regardless, out $200....sucky, but what do you do? : / The last day of the conference we called the front desk and asked for a cab (as we had been doing all weekend) and when they arrived, the person at the front desk informed us they were here.

I told him I understood that but 1st of all - They were not upfront about the transportation provided. I would NEVER have booked there if I had known that. And when I call the front desk and ask for a taxi, thats what I'd like!! NOT a ""private driver"" whom your hotel has a contract with (straight from the mouth of the driver. They refused to do anything for us - even take us to the airport where they'd obviously be picking people up anyway! Another group of people staying in the hotel informed us then, that the night drivers would take them anywhere they wanted and indeed did take them to the convention center the night prior. I was absolutely floored at the complete disregard for customer service at this hotel! 

I only wish it ended there -  I accidentally left 2 (quite expensive) dresses hanging in the closet of my room. I called 3 days in a row and kept getting passed to lost and found and to housekeeping who ""could not find them."" I knew this would turn out poorly based on my experience. :( Alas, they have looked everywhere and do not have the dresses. Obviously, they jumped off of the hanger and walked themselves straight out of that hotel. My fault for leaving them - Yes. Let me pay for you to ship them to me.

Valet is across the street behind a gate  - we could see from our room.  Has a bar and restaurant on premises. We had a 2 double bed room with balcony - loved it!  Very spacious, had a side area with a breakfast table and also a mini refrigerator. Courtyard with pool. We did share a balcony with 2 other rooms but did not bother us. Valet very quick about getting our vehicle when we checked out. Free Wi-Fi

Cons: The entire staff could use a more customer service personality from valet, front desk, all the way to bar. It's not that they are rude - more like you are an inconvenience to them.  Restaurant was closed due to a water issue.  Bar has $3 martini's during happy hour. What is wrong with that? They don't tell hotel guest (or at least they didn't share with me and it's my fav drink!) and isn't on the chalkboard in lobby that talks about happy hour times and restaurant.  I found out my last day by looking at Yelp reviews!  Never had hot water in shower - luke warm but we survived. Pool - limited sun due to it being in the courtyard but this is pretty common in the area. Wi-Fi barely worked - most of the time we turned it off than our 2nd day there the password no longer worked.  Apparently it changes every few weeks and we were there when it changed.  Wouldn't have known unless I asked....  

Overall - I think it was overpriced but I booked with it being spring break and limited availability in French Quarter.  Would consider staying again in future if price was right now that I know what to expect.",0.11582080200501253

Homewood Suites by Hilton New Orleans,New Orleans,4.0,"Back in my working days, I traveled extensively. My hotel chain of choice was Hilton properties. 
Consequently, I still have a bank of points I'm using. 
Upon check in, we were upgraded to a corner suite. I will freely admit, the upgrade may taint my review, however I will do my best to be objective. 
The common areas like the lobby and restaurant are very nice and look like they've been updated not too long ago. The elevators are fast and moving between the lobby and our 7th floor room was very quick. 
Our room was huge. It looked as if the room had been painted recently and the carpet was decent. I also think the bed was fairly new and pretty comfortable. 
The one thing that was less than nice was the kitchen area. The cabinets had definitely seen better days. Some cabinet doors wouldn't close and hung crooked. Next to the dishwasher the base cabinet had been wet numerous times and was blackened and the finish is coming off. Quite nasty looking. Wall paper above the cabinets is coming loose and peeling off. 
The first time we used the toilet, I noticed the tank was about to fall off. You could rock it back and forth with one finger. I contacted the front desk and within minutes maintenance was knocking on our door and fixed the toilet. 
Additionally after three days in our room, the room next to us was rented. Unfortunately, the inhabitants ignored the rules and shortly after their check in we started smelling cigarette smoke. The smell got stronger the next morning. I reported it to the front desk and it was addressed immediately. From that point forward, we no longer smelled smoke. The staff was awesome. One thing that I didn't like, there was never fresh hot coffee available first thing in the morning. The couple times I inquired why there was no fresh coffee available, I was told it would be available when breakfast was served and not  before. EVERY Hilton property I've stayed at previously had hot fresh coffee available starting at early as 5 am.  I was inquiring at 6 am.  I would definitely stay here again.",0.11229693383539538

I used to stay here with my grandparents in the 80's so I was excited to re-visit that piece of my childhood.... Unfortunately that didn't happen. Since we checked in, I have been repeatedly let down. 

1st- I asked the concierge about upcoming Mardi Gras parades and he gruffly told me none were coming up for weeks. He didn't offer to look, suggest something else to do, etc. He was too busy chatting with another employee. (Btw I walked past a parade on Bourbon about an hour ago)  

2nd- Checked in and went to lunch. When we came back to our room the door was open. I asked a Maid down the hall if she was working in my room (why would she be? We just checked in) and she rudely said No. I spoke to the housekeeping manager and she was kind about the situation but I never received word on what was really going on! 

3rd- can't breathe! My co-worker is sneezing and teary-eyed after stepping foot into the hotel. If you take a look at the room filters, you can probably assume why. Once back on the street she is fine, which is really sad considering it's Bourbon Street) 

4th- the place is old, smelly and dingy. Walking down the hallway feels like a scene from ""The Shining"". 

5th- why are we in a handicapped room? 

6th- the shower head is broken and you have to hold it up while you bathe.

Sheraton Tucson Hotel & Suites,Tucson,3.0,"My family and I stay at the Sheraton Tucson on E. Grant several times a year, that is 4 families, at least 4 or more times per year, so quite a lot of regular business over the last six years.  Our father was living at the Forum Independent living complex property next door to the Sheraton on E. Grant in Tucson, so it was always very convenient.  The last few months, our visits were more frequent, as our dad was in and out of the hospital often.  He died last week, and all four of the adult siblings needed to stay at the Sheraton to arrange for dad's funeral and the closing up of his apartment.  Though the rooms at the Sheraton are fine, the cleaning staff is friendly, and the Glow Ball restaurant people are kind, I must say that all of us experienced terrible service from the front desk staff.  Rude, unprofessional, unhelpful, several reservation mistakes were made by the staff, and they were unapologetic, even when they did admit the mistakes were their own 'human error'.  It was incredibly stressful, especially with the Gem Show in town, there was no place else to stay, and the front desk had managed to bungle some of our reservations.  They were unsympathetic (they all knew we were in town to bury our father), and unyielding, unwilling to help, and it left an incredibly bitter feeling.  If I had worked the front desk, with regular clients, I would have bent over backwards to help, solve problems, be apologetic and professional, generous and kind. None of that happened.  Only upon check-out, did Pierre offer condolences.  But for the intermittent two week stay before that, the front desk was so negative, I actually avoided going through the lobby at all times.  A smile goes a long way.  A kind word. A drink voucher. A breakfast.  Any of those offerings would have helped smooth things over. But that did not happen.  Upon moving to another hotel, which was less convenient and more expensive, we still all breathed a sigh of relief that we would not have to ever step foot into the Sheraton Tucson lobby again, or ever have to again deal with the confrontational front desk staff.  Time for the Sheraton Tucson to rethink customer service- the front desk is the front line to your clients.  Learn to smile, be helpful, and accommodating.  This is, after all, a ""hospitality"" business!  
All this said- I want to compliment the bar staff for being super friendly and preparing delicious drinks.  And the new Glow Ball restaurant was really good (omg, the salmon! yum.).

Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"This is a belated review of a stay that took place in mid-June as part of a weekend getaway.  I always try to avoid 'broad brush definitives' but thinking back I can say that I basically hated everything about that stay. The check-in was both cold and a bit rude. Marriott Elite status was not offered anything whatsoever despite their very low occupancy. The extent of food/beverage was bar service by the pool that ended at 7:00.  Thankfully there were some locations along the Riverwalk that did have their act together. The automatic door returning from the pool area offers its own special challenges (multiple frustrated guests). 
My lower floor room facing a busy intersection was extremely noisy for multiple hours. I have a set of rarely-used earplugs just in case, and if you choose to stay here, I recommend you have them as well. Smoking is not allowed here (which is good) but my room had one discarded cigarette inside, and one on the balcony, as well as a BIC lighter. I certainly question their housekeeping. There is a coffee maker and some packages of coffee in the room. The expiration date on the coffee was several months past, and the sugar packets were crunchy from storage dampness. A used coffee packet was still in the maker from an earlier guest. 
The is no louver on the entry door to the room, but I would swear there was, as loud as any noise from the hall would come into the room. The door didn't seem to have a bad seal at all, so I can't explain it. Noise came from both sides of the room during the stay which doesn't promote any quality sleep.
I do NOT recommend this location to anyone.  I would not repeat a stay here myself. I did advise the night team at the front desk of my concerns, as well as a message to manager Andrew G, but I've heard nothing, and didn't really expect it.

Indianapolis Marriott Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"Judy J.

I am highly upset at the rude and callous service I received at this hotel on Sunday, March 24, 2019. I made my reservation online, indicating I am disabled and would need bath/tub accommodations, and would arrive between 11 am and 12 noon. I did so.

When I arrived with other patrons, many there to attend the American Association of Blacks in Higher Education (AABHE) conference, chaos and confusion greeted us. Staff explained a volleyball tournament had just ended and those patrons were checking out. The clog at the desk continued; though many got rooms I did not.

I was told my disabled accommodations weren't ready. I asked repeatedly from 1 to 5:45 pm, getting sicker from my ankle braces causing swelling. I had traveled from California and had been on my feet for nearly 24 hours. I'm on a cane and staff saw that I was exhausted and had lost my voice. I missed the plenary session and the first day of  conference because my $759 room wasn't ready. The front desk manager offered two free breakfasts in apology.

I'm going to overlook the obvious, that most of the volleyball team were young white females, and most AABHE attendees were black. I just know this wasn't a pushed-to-the-back-of-the-bus micro aggression. Not in Indianapolis in 2019. If it was a snafu, that indicates poor planning or overbooking.

Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"My check in process was more than amazing. He was polite, smiled and went above and beyond. Upon my check out my boyfriend and I decided to hang out at the pool because our flight left late that day. By the poolside I needed to use the bathroom and I saw two ladies walk out of the these glass doors. I assumed that's where the bathrooms were so I headed in that direction. This girl from the bar (natalie/natalia) hauled towards me and stuck her long arm out in front of me to stop me from entering and yelled at me telling me I couldn't go in there.
     I was confused as to why she was being this rude and yelled at me in front of all these people considering she works in hospitality, but proceeded to ask her where the bathrooms were. All she said was ""the bathrooms are there & there"". With no direction. I asked her again and she pointed towards the lobby. 
       Personally, I'm well aware that every hotel pool has pool bathrooms and I'm not going to walk through the lobby with a bathing suit on. So I found the pool bathrooms on my own & while I was away Natalie took it upon herself to go and ask my boyfriend if we were even guests at this hotel who belonged there. He answered yes and then she asked him what room number we were in.
    I have worked for hotels before, specifically Marriott and I know exactly what Natalie is doing. She was rude from the beginning and then judgmental and racist. No other white person at the pool was being asked if they had a room at the hotel or if they belonged there. 
    I talked to my boyfriend about the situation because he saw Natalie yell at me by the bar & he told me how this girl waited for me to leave his side just to ask him whether or not we were guests at this hotel. He said ""in this society, especially when it comes to white people, I'm used to this kind of behavior"".
     Well I'm here to use MY white privilege to tell you that I'm not used to this nasty behavior and I will not tolerate it whatsoever.
     This uncultured little girl is rude, judgmental and racist and shouldn't be working for Marriott. I'm not sure if this is the first or one of many reviews about this person but I don't see myself staying at any Marriott until they get rid of people who are racist. Its been 3 days since this situation and I really tried to refrain from writing a review at all, but it just bothers me so badly, how people like natalie exist. 
    I sent an email to the management of the Sheraton property and he emailed back that the pool was open to the public as well. Now, I'm even more confused as to why she question if we belonged there or not. I emailed back asking him why we were treated such a way and I have not received an answer. Poor/racist staff and poor management. No, thank you. I travel once or twice a month. I'll happily take my business elsewhere.",0.030405405405405407

Sheraton Tucson Hotel & Suites,Tucson,1.0,"Normally, one has to wait to submit feedback before one stays at the hotel. However, my experience with the front desk was so poor that I could not help but report to warn other guests. I called the Marriott Sheraton Tucson Hotel & Suites to get some clarifications about the room and the hotel. First of all, they put me on a 15 min hold. Then, an unbelievably rude female came on the line. She would not even give her name, and was not willing to answer basic questions like room, amenities, etc. about my upcoming stay. They put me on long holds and then transferred me to unattended voice mail boxes.  I called several times, and most of the times this same person or other people just hung up.

Hilton Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,1.0,"My husband and I recently chose the Hilton Westshore/Tampa Airport location to host many of our out of town family and friends by booking a block of rooms for our wedding on June 17th. We were honestly very disappointed and truly embarrassed with our decision. Initially, the hotel staff seemed accommodating and helpful until we decided to book the rooms! It was hard to get ahold of them, the staff seemed confused as to when rooms were/were not available in our block of rooms, and the pricing that we were promised for our guests seemed hit or miss depending on who our guests spoke with. About 2 weeks before the wedding I received an email stating the suite that I had booked for 2 nights (for my bridesmaids and myself to get ready in) was actually not available. They said a now fired manager booked that room for other guests over a year ago so they get the room. They said they did feel bad though and would find us 2 connecting rooms for those 2 nights and they would be comped. Problem is, when it was time to check out on Sunday...we were being charged for both! And after speaking to the front desk, nothing could be done (even with email proof) because no manager was on duty. I wish it ended there! As guests began arriving Thursday night, they were charged almost twice as much for a room. The following day 1 of the reservations was canceled for the next 2 night, with their belongings being locked in their room. The front desk staff said they could pay more to continue to have a room Friday/Saturday night even though these nights were already included in their reservation! Other guests were greeted with rooms were dirty (food left in the room), broken a/c, and a rude front desk staff. My first night there (Friday night) not one light on the Hilton sign, in the parking lot, or in the area you pull your vehicle up were on. This seemed very unsafe!  Eventually the ""comped"" rooms were taken care of by calling a manager at home, and the mysteriously canceled rooms were allowed back in, but from such a reputable name like Hilton we were truly outraged with the amount of issued our guests and ourselves faced! I would not recommend using this hotel to my many family and friends getting married in the Tampa Bay area in the near future, we expected much more from a Hilton!",-0.03872549019607844

"Chateau LeMoyne - French Quarter, A Holiday Inn Hotel",New Orleans,1.0,"I must say that I wasn't impressed with the service that I got here at this hotel. I recently came here on a girls trip to New Orleans and I was impressed with the room, it was clean and tidy, restroom was nice but I beg to differ about the service.  We stayed for three nights to do different sight seeing around the city and plantation tours so we weren't in our room as much. The guys at valet were very nice and friendly but the valet parking is overly expensive- $45 a day, yikes. The guys that were giving free tours were very nice and helpful, we had no problem. As far as front desk service that was a different issue there. On the day of check out I found out that we didn't get the actual price quote that was given to us when a friend who booked the trip called on the phone and only booked ONE ROOM for six people instead of two. I ended up paying $110 more than I was expected to pay. Front desk attendant was rude and not friendly at all. The only thing that I liked was the convenience to Bourbon Street and other surrounding areas around the city. For being the second time I've visited New Orleans I have yet to receive great service in this town.  Will not return back ever.",0.2453964646464647
Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans French Quarter/Iberville,New Orleans,4.0,"Pros; 
Great location. It's within spitting distance to Bourbon St. Clean rooms. Friendly, helpful staff. Free wifi. No bedbugs at all. I checked. I looked under the mattress for ""pepper"". I did not find any. Furthermore, they had the fancy covered electrical outlets so that bedbugs cannot hide in them. It also makes these outlets child proof. The rooms had very strong A/C and were very quiet. In contrast, I saw some other hotels in Bourbon street with screaming drinkers on the balcony. I'm glad I did not book a room there! They had a tiny gym with one Smith type machine and a set of dumbells plus an exercise bike. It was adequate. 

Cons; 
The parking situation. The parking is $38 PER NIGHT!!! Parking is NOT included in your night's stay at the hotel!!! If it weren't for the parking situation, this hotel would get 5 stars and be perfect. Parking should be included. People budget $X for their stay and $38 per night could throw off some people's budgets. If parking is not included, then they should write in bold print in the hotel's description in all the travel websites that parking is $38 per night. 

Response to Others' Reviews; 
Liivii P: room service and maid service sucked? I did not order room service so I don't know. I tipped the maid $5 per night so my maid service was great. She gave me plenty of towels to use and the room was absolutely spotless. Thin walls? The a/c unit produced a lot of ""white noise"" and I drank a lot of alcohol so I fell asleep and did not notice the thin walls. Loud roller doors? They seemed quiet to me. If it seems loud, just ask maintenance to spray some wd40 on it. The toilet was broken in my room so I called for maintenance. I went out to eat and by the time I came back, it was fixed. 

Belly G; loud ""whooshing noise""? Yes the A/c unit is loud. However, it didn't bother me as it is kinda like the engine noise on a jet plane. It is ""white noise"". If you cannot fall asleep on a jet, then bring some earplugs. I fall asleep just fine on airplanes. 

Timothy H, Teri D; $50 cash deposit? Rude staff? I was really nice to the check in girl. I complimented her on her gorgeous braided hair. She did not charge me the deposit. She even gave me 2 free maps of the city and told me where the hottest bands were playing that night. I work with the public and nothing bothers me more than rude customers who think they can steamroll over you. EVERY hotel, no matter how great and expensive, has some crap rooms that they're about to remodel. Act arrogant and treat the staff like crap? Well, guess which room you're getting?! I always treat the staff nice and tip them $5 to $10 here and there so I always get the best rooms and my room is always cleaned spotless. 

Summary; everything was perfect except for the parking, which costs $38 a night.",0.2076587301587301
Tucson Marriott University Park,Tucson,1.0,"Firstly we have been staying here for the last few yrs for the gem and mineral show. However, we will never stay here again. 

Upon entering the room it smelled like vomit. So we put our stuff down and tried to find what was causing such a smell. The bathroom......! There was vomit on the floor on the toilet, walls, door, wood shelf under sink for towels....YES THERE WAS VOMIT ON THE TOWELS LEFT FOR US TO USE!  So it had been a long trip we were hungry went downstairs gave our information to the gal that checked us in, she was shocked and stated it will be rechecked  immediately. We(myself husband father) stayed we would be picking up family at airport and then going to dinner that should be more than enough time to have the restroom cleaned so we can use it. 

Upon our return........NOTHING WAS CLEANED. They only sprayed a bunch of febreeze to mask the smell.  nothing was wiped down nothing was clean. I went down the front desk,  thinking I'd be able to get someone in there to clean. I was told manager was busy and I'd have to wait. The young girl I think her name was Alyssa was so rude stating they sent someone up to the room I must be wrong! Wth really? FYI finish college honey and maybe hit the books a little harder or take a business course and learn some customer service and manners too!  I THE CUSTOMER have a problem I come to YOU for help, I GIVE YOUR ESTABLISHMENT $$$ in exchange for services rendered. My $$ pays for your payroll or do you think payroll is just something freely given??  I digress, While I waited 10 mins for him(I think his name was Marshall) to come out of his office(seriously at like 10pm what else needed his attention? It felt like he was he doing it on purpose to run out the clock. No customer service) while I was waiting I watched the cleaning lady look at me and smile and giggle and leave for the night. The manager came out shortly after. He was rude from the start stating he had no idea what I was talking about and the cleaning lady had just left for the night and that they both went into my room and saw nothing.....so I took pictures of everything prior to walking down to speak to him. Smh I showed him the photos and he stated again that house keeping is gone for the night and he would have maintenance come up to the room. They did not come up so I went and bought disinfectant wipes from the cvs around the corner and cleaned the bathroom myself. While I WAS CLEANING UP maintenance came up with disinfectant wipes, the same Lysol shit I bought. I asked him if he smelt anything in here still and he said yeah who puked...I asked him to clean the bathroom again and bring some bleach or something strong and fresh towels....never happened.... while I went to get a drink at the bar to relax since I couldn't do it in my room. And no not the bar inside the hotel the one around the corner. 

I wanted to change rooms but was told nothing else was available, by the same night manager as before. 

The room was never cleaned by staff and I did it myself. Not only did we pay $2000.00 plus to stay at the motel opps I meant hotel or maybe not, I had to clean it myself. Because it doesn't matter how much febreeze you spray if you don't clean up vomit the smell stays.....why because it's human bile, stomach acids and digested food and it's gross beyond words. 

We were comped a breakfast for myself and each guest with but honestly if you cant clean a bathroom right I'm not about to eat anything cooked there either. And instead of doing it to my face the note was slipped under my door. No acknowledgment of how disgusting it is to find someone else puke in your room. 

We will not be returning next yr and have already made other arrangements. I understand it's a college area and that kids can be stupid and grosss but I am however a tax paying adult on vaca/ business for the gem and mineral show, which my family has been a part of since the 1970's. We like to try different places in Tucson when we go especially since everything is changing but we won't be going to this Marriott again.  I'm adding all the photos I took of the bathroom too bad I couldn't provide the smell that I had to endure. FYI there wasn't anything available anywhere at the time we went Tucson books up quickly when the gem and mineral show is going on, it's an international show.......smh Marriott. I wanted to scream I've been treated better at a motel 6 than this. It wasn't like this the yr prior, it was clean the staff were great I don't know what happened. I'm trying to find the letter if I do a photo will be posted also.  There were many opportunities for management and staff to make things better but instead you made me feel like I was a bother a problem.

Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans French Quarter/CBD,New Orleans,1.0,"Worst hotel experience ever. From the time we pulled up to unload our car from the time we left, just awful. The valet driver acted like he didn't see us as we began to unload our belongings onto the pavement after asking for a luggage cart that never came. 

We waited over 50 minutes for our food to be cooked at the hotel grill, then it was brought to us and served to us cold by a rude waiter who said that if he re-heated the food it would be tough and change the texture. After dinner we went to our room and went straight to bed but noticed that there was a damp stain on our bed. Rather than complain again to staff who surely does not care, we removed the hotel blanket and went to sleep. 

Around 2am 2 drunk men and a woman banged on our door and walked into our room laughing and cursing. They reeked of cigarettes and alcohol as they walked over to our bed and acted as surprised to see us as we were surprised and terrified to see them. They told us the front desk gave them a key and told them it was their room. When I went downstairs to the lobby to complain that this group of people had keys that unlocked our room, they told me there was no record of us ever being in that room and bc they didn't have us in their system.

Hilton Garden Inn New Orleans French Quarter/CBD,New Orleans,1.0,"We stayed at the Hilton Garden Garden Inn French Quarter New Orleans February 21-February 23.
 
Friday night we checked in-- no problems really. Just the A/C was not working properly. We were told before the got to the hotel that we were supposed to be given wristbands, because of all of the people in the area, because of Mardi Gras. We were never given wristbands. We went to sleep and left very early Saturday morning.
 
We came back to the hotel at 11:00PM on February 22nd after being gone all day. Upon exiting the elevator on our floor, two very drunk guys were running and stumbling. Obviously this was no big deal until we walked just a few feet away to our hotel room door. Our hotel room door was open with the latch between the door. I freaked out. I was like hello hello, I was first of all scared someone was in the room and did not want to go in. I opened the door and quickly looked and saw no one was in the room. I was still freaking out looking around making sure I didn't see anything taken. To my knowledge, nothing was taken from our room. However, our door had been left open all day after the housekeeper went in. The bed was made and towels were in the bathroom, so housekeeping was obviously in the room. This is a huge deal to us. Our bedroom door should NEVER been left open. This hotel does not have cameras on the hallways, so we have no way of knowing that no one came in our room or nothing was stolen. We may notice later something is missing.
We called down to the front desk after we got into the room. Just was very nice and apologized. She said she would call the manager and let the manger know. The manager was supposed to call us in the morning. THIS NEVER HAPPENED. In fact, the front desk manager, Treesha did not even know what we were talking about when we finally called the front desk that morning.
 
I worked in the hotel industry for YEARS. Anything that happens on a shift is supposed to be reported and documented. This did not happen. She also did not even tell the person who worked the next shift. This needs to be addressed.
 
I am assuming that no one that night told or did anything, is because I was later told by Pam the Housekeeping manager, that this happens all the time. That is completely unacceptable. This should not be happening all the time. Its one thing, that if someone breaks into a room-- obviously you do not have any control over that. But the fact that it happens all the time, that customers doors are left open, anyone can go in and steal peoples things. I am NOT ok with that. This hotel may be ok with that level of careless disregard for customer service and personal belongings, but I am not.
 
So, we went to the front desk before we were leaving on Sunday, to try to talk to someone in person.
 
-Staffing Issue that needs to be addressed: There was only one person working the front desk during this hotels BUSIEST time of the year. There were numerous people waiting in line to check out or talk to the front desk. This needs to be addressed ASAP. This hotel made a killing this weekend and there needed to be adequate staff to handle a sold out hotel.
 
-In addition to the staffing issue-- there was no manager on duty. Being that this was the busiest weekend of the year, the General Manager, or an actual manager who actually cares about their customers should have been there. The front desk manager was super rude, and did not even attempt to even talk to us.

Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"Let me start off by blaming myself entirely for not checking Yelp beforehand, about this property, and just relying on Google and TripAdvisor. Clearly their reviews are lies. 

To start, valet parking only? Um... ok I guess, but $30?? Next, my husband walked in first to make sure that we could check in early. So he got the keys, we got in the elevator, opened our room door and to our surprise, there was still a guest in the room. What the actual hell...? First time this has happened to us! So we quickly closed the door and headed downstairs. As we're waiting for her to finish her conversation with another employee, I asked her if there were any corner rooms available. Which she just shook her head no and kept talking to her friend and when I asked again because when we were up on the floor, there was a corner room being cleaned that we would have waited for. She turned to me, pausing her conversation with the other employee, lowered her mask and said ""there aren't any corner rooms available right now and those are our suites, they cost $400 a night'. I felt my face go into WTF mode and just collected myself because it was my husbands birthday and I did not want to unleash myself and mess it all up. Really lady? Really? Did I ask how much it was? How effing rude. So whatever, I'm trying to behave and keep my hubby happy so we just turned the other cheek and continued upstairs to our ""not corner room suite that cost $400/night"" room. Nothing special here. The view is the best thing about it. But there's still the obstruction of their dining room roof. I would suggest the decorator should have a mural painted so there's something nice to look at. The city of Tampa has a billion and one murals around; I'm sure someone would be up for the job. 

As someone stated in another review. The room is not that great. Walls need to be cleaned and the bathroom ceiling has to be done over. There was an opened water bottle that clearly wasn't replaced for us. No conditioner or toothpaste. Sheets on the lower part of the bed, which aren't as important but still should matter, are stained yellow. We specifically asked for extra towels and pillows, which we didn't get. The television didn't work either. We tried turning it on manually and checking it to see if it was plugged - which is was - but it did not work. The door on the TV stand is hanging on one hinge. Oh and the duvet needs more feathers or whatever the inside is. It was super thin. Towels were thin, old and super stiff. 

Overall, this has got to be the worst ""hotel"" that we've ever stayed in. It's more of a glorified MOTEL with the name Sheraton on it. They really need to work on quality control and front desk attitude. I'd be willing be to come back and review again once those issues have been dealt with. Until then, we'll never stay in this hotel again.

I obviously come in pissed around 2:45am; but first and foremost.... how the f*ck are you not going to apologize when YOU canceled my reservation that I did check in for (and noted I'd be checking in after 10pm). Second, instead of being kind this woman really like to be combative and argue. Literally at one point I held my hand up and said ""I'm not going to go back and forth with you. Just get my room taken care of"". LASTLY.... this c*nt had the nerve to say ""I was able to waive your no-show fee""... WHO DIDNT SHOW UP?! BECAUSE I CHECKED IN. Acting like you're doing me a favor when you aren't even doing your job. Isn't Customer Service the main thing? Someone needs to fire her or send her through some EXTENSIVE re-training because I can only imagine other peoples experience.

So I wake up and notice my car has been charged and it's $400 more than it should have been. I go to the front desk and speak with Jalisa. She was actually efficient and competent, and most importantly... APOLOGETIC FOR MY EXPERIENCE UNLIKE B*TCH A** VAL. She advises me $200 is deposit that will be refunded, and $200 is for the no-show cancelation..... AGAIN, INCUMBENT VAL TOLD ME SHE WAIVED THIS FEE (even though I WAS NOT A NO-SHOW!!!). Jalisa did confirm she was able to get that removed. At this point... I am so taken back by my experience that I am literally going to leave a review on every possible site that I can and warn people to choose another hotel for their stay in New Orleans. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME, EFFORT, or MONEY ON THIS.

Oh wait.... they have work chairs with stains in them, black marks on the glass (looks like eyeliner and can wipe off.... did no one clean the mirrors or this room?). Disappointment all around.",0.12704414838035527
Homewood Suites by Hilton Indianapolis-Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"TERRIBLE MANAGEMENT!!! I stayed at this hotel in room 310 for a fun weekend. I woke up Sunday morning and found a bed bug running across my chest which I then killed and showed to management. Jonathon, the director of operations, came up and didn't bring a bag or anything to put it in. He then dropped it off of the towel as he was leaving, but didn't notice. So we called him back in and he picked it up off of the floor and left. He said he would call us by the next day, but he never did. He also acted as if we brought the bed bug with us and treated us terribly. I called and left multiple messages the days following and the guy was avoiding me. He finally called to tell me the bug I had showed him had been dead for weeks (it was running across my chest and filled with fresh blood when I killed it). He said he called in a professional service to look for bed bugs and that they found no bed bugs, but that's not possible I have bites everywhere and have had to see a Dr for treatment. My fiancé and the other two people that stayed in the room have bites as well. Jonathon then said that he could do nothing about it and was nothing but rude throughout the entire process.",-0.09625

Sheraton Tampa Riverwalk Hotel,Tampa,1.0,"I originally had a reservation at the Marriott which i regret not keeping. This hotel could learn a thing or two about customer service. People were just plain rude and not helpful. The room was fine so ill credit housekeeping for that. The view is nothing to write home about especially since they are doing construction at this time. Their ""free shuttle "" service is a joke. I never even saw the shuttle and after being told 3 different times when the shuttle stopped running the manager of the valet/shuttle was quick to argue the next morning over where it ran to and what they would or wouldnt do. I was also told how it was just a complimentary service and theyre not obligated to accommodate the requests.... One night i asked to have a taxi called for me and was told to ""just walk over a few blocks to the HILTON and theyll have a cabs for you""...umm okay, so i walked over there and yep no taxi anywhere around. Also its NOT OPTIONAL to have valet or self parking...online it doesnt include that you have to pay valet if you have a car there. I just thought it was an option not an added expense.

Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans French Quarter/Iberville,New Orleans,2.0,"Stayed here for Decadence, and I will admit, I was a bit apprehensive booking this hotel in the beginning.  I decided to go against my better judgement and book it anyway.

I should've listened to my better judgement.

When I arrived, granted it was a little early for check-in.  However the young lady that was at the front desk was extremely rude, and talked to me as if I were a child when I questioned the amount that would be held for incidentals (why do hotels still do this??).  You see, I called the hotel the day before traveling to New Orleans and inquired and was told $25.  I arrived and the young lady (who was rude by the way) told me that no, they're going to hold $50.  Trying to explain that I was told a different amount fell on deaf ears with her.

I left the hotel to await a phone call from them telling me the room was ready.  When I finally got one (45 minutes later), I returned and spoke to the manager, who accepted a $25 cash deposit and informed me that it was indeed, $25.  Don't know what her problem was....

Now to talk abou the room.  The room itself was a nice suite, overlooking the French Quarter.  The bathroom was a nice size and had good water pressure.  The bedding (and the sofa in the front of the suite) were very comfortable, and I didn't have any issue with the air conditioning (a very important thing in New Orleans in September).

Customer service is everything and people working in hospitality should realize that.  Because of the absolute rudeness of the front desk person (even though the manager corrected it), I'll have to seriously question staying here again.",0.164864953886693

Rude staff from time we got there... Uncomfortable temperature in rooms with thick, stiff bedding. Full review should post on trip adviser within 48 hours...

The lady at the front desk had no idea we had been drenched all night and upon explaining to her the reaction was unbelievable. Not only did she imply immediately that we would be paying for the room but she acted as if it was our fault!!! She said : ""Did you even call maintenance about the issue?"" Of course we had done so immediately and maintenance had come (only to identify the problem as a ceiling leak...duh)but she had no idea of any of it... 

They refused to discount or comp any part of our stay even though we purchased 3 rooms and spent over $200 at dinner in the hotels cafe. (COTY OUR SERVER WAS WONDERFUL...THE ONLY REDEEMING PART OF OUR STAY. BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY WE WONT BE BACK TO SEE HIM)... No manager apologized or probably even knew what happened.

If you book through Priceline, they will give you their worst rooms. I've stayed here on four occasions and finally had enough, I'll never stay here again. My room was always damp and reeked of cigarette smoke. The bed sheets were disgusting, hard, lumpy and stained. The furniture is chipped and old. The front desk staff is mostly unhelpful, and the housekeeping knocks at your door an hour before checkout and on one occasion was standing outside of my door an hour before checkout time knocking and waiting for me to leave, and walked in right as I was leaving, I actually held my door open for her, because I was the only one in that situation with manners. Completely rude and unprofessional to rush people out of their rooms EARLY while they're still in them. The lobby is nice and it's in a good location in town, and that's about it.

Indianapolis Marriott East,Indianapolis,2.0,"Was forced to stay there for a soccer tournament. While the front staff and housekeeping were very nice and friendly the hotel in general made us feel unwelcomed.  Signs posted every ten feet and every access door basically saying kids are not allowed outside their rooms without adults under age 14.  I don't have a problem with that its the way the security guard (Paul Blart wanna be) handled it. My over 14 son stepped out of the room to get ice down the hall and the guard made him go back in the room. He actually followed him to our door. Again a group of 14 year old sitting on a couch texting while other kids running around he goes over and yells at them again. Yes I know they were not doing anything I was in the lobby too sitting on a couch watching the boys.  They were so busy yelling at different players for no reason they missed a creepy guy who just walked in to the hotel barely dressed keep trying to talk to the boys then going into our conference room and try to take the boys pizza.  When a parent went to the guard basically response was what do you want me to do about it.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New Orleans,New Orleans,3.0,"The location of the hotel is truly ideal - and the price reflects this - and overall the hotel is nicely appointed, clean, and up to date.  Paper thin walls allow one to overhear the elevators, noisy neighbors, and relentless conversation in the hallway...particularly when one's neighbors decide to host a street festival in the hallway outside of their adjoining rooms.  We noticed several other people opened their doors to yell at the group, yet they ignored them and continued to socialize, laugh, and otherwise make a pestilence of themselves.  

Although a discreet call to security put an end to that, the cacophony continued in the room next to ours for hours.  When we left early the next day, our bellman was very friendly, and I attempted to help him load the luggage cart...making sure to smash my largest piece of luggage against the door connecting to the adjoining room.  NOW, of course, noise was a problem for the occupants, and the drunken skank/ruffian/hobo from next door decided he wished to open his hallway door to glare at us and the bellman...but I suppose he decided nine hundred pounds of beef was a little more than he wanted to grab by the horns, so he marched his sawed off little garden gnome tail back into his room.  Smart move, sweetie...very smart.

Meanwhile, although the staff was personable and accommodating, overall the noise issues in the hotel have more to do with poor soundproofing than other guests.  We could hear the wail of every police siren from 100 feet below, all night long, even though these sounds had been muted at our other hotel just down the street.  This was a good hotel otherwise, but I really noticed the noise.

She completely ignored me, and she wouldn't look at me. When I got her attention reminding her that my family member was on hold, she acted as if she couldn't see that there was someone on hold on the phone. It seemed as if she thought if she kept ignoring me, I would just go away. I had to yell and then finally the manager came out to help.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Tucson - Reid Park,Tucson,1.0,"Was not happy from the start. I flew in from another state for an event. My flight landed at about 10:45pm.  Thank goodness my sister got in before I did.  She let me know that none of us had a room.  My confirmation email clearly gave me the exact dates I had reservations for.  She was able to get her room straightened out but not mine they didn't have any more rooms so my hubby and I hurried to find another one before we got there so we could have a place to sleep. My sister said the double tree had room 264 reserved for us the rest of the weekend. I got over it although I was not too happy about having to unpack and pack twice.  When I got there I asked for an upstairs room but the bottom one was the only one available very far from my family members. I didn't like her tone and the fact she would not look at me and spoke over me talking to my sister.  She was just very condescending.  Instead she smiled and gave me a cookie lol. Oh I wanted to climb over that counter and ugh nevermind...

Later the event went well but then our family got together at the Cantina and the food and beverage person Mike was so rude to my 70 year old aunt and barked at her like a small little chihuahua saying if any more relatives come we will need to cut them off. At that point about 30% of the family left and some if us stayed.  It wasn't our fault they would ran out of food and alcohol (which tasted watered down. Yes Mike we did notice). We were having a great time. Some of us were watching the baseball game some of us were taking selfies. None of us were drunk. When my brother ordered a round of shot Mike barked at him too saying you're cut off like some kind of mastiff drueling and spitting out of his mouth lol. My hubby finally asked him why have you been so rude to our family all evening?  His only answer was I can decide to be and stated would you like to leave now?

Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,4.0,"I came to the Marriott Downtown for the yearly huge ISTE conference (largest EdTech conference in the world w/18K+people!) at the Philadelphia convention center.

Check in was unusually rough & annoying. As a member of the ISTE Board of Directors I had a king room reserved near an elevator - it wasn't ready early at 1:00pm when I came in all hot & sticky from the Amtrak train, cab, & a 100degree humid June day. It wasn't until after my 9pm meeting (and a temporary dbl room to change & a wasted $20 tip to desk mgr. ) that they finally got me into Rm 1076 - a lovely King near the elevator - on the side of the building that is closest to the 3rd floor bridge to the Convention Center which is key because the hallways are FOOTBALL FIELD LENGTH LONG! Whew! Seriously, if you're coming for a conference at the convention center and don't want to add another 10 min walk each way to your room make sure you get a high numbered room!

The newly renovated room was gorgeous! 42"" LCD LG TV, sleek marble bathroom w/rain shower head, crisp sheet covered feather duvet & a plethora of pillows. It also had a nice view of the rotating guitar of the Hard Rock Cafe. Sadly, the bed hurt my back (unlike the Sofitel!)  so I asked for another feather duvet & with judicious doubling up created a feather bed topper. I also asked for a REFRIGERATOR which was not standard for bottles of water, Diet Coke, and fruit. Nice that they delivered it & plugged it in whilst I was at a meeting. The Marriott is a Pepsi hotel but there's a 7-11 out the front door and a Wine & Spirits shop out the back door (across the street from the outdoor cafe) Also close by a Hard Rock Cafe, Melting Pot, & an Italian place where I had a lovely but pricey lunch called Maggiano's.

Hotels will generally try and provide items that you need if they are not included. I've previously requested table or box fans to put me to sleep and provide air movement - too bad the Marriott didn't have any. Always TIP WELL when you are brought a requested item & thank them with a warm grateful smile!

There are 2 lobby bars - one in the middle of the lboby that's round, contemporary, pretty, comfy, but usually full and another Level 13 across the bank of elevators. Handy for meetings as they have a few tables near outlets for laptops - SCORE! Prices for drinks are high - $9.00 for a glass of Chardonnay and $7 for a bottle of Yeuingling.

Much has been said on Trip Advisor & Yelp about the rude service but after I got into my room the people were all lovely and accommodating as could be! I had 2 ROOM SERVICE meals that were delivered faster than estimated, piping hot, & tasty with only one hitch. I was disappointed when the cheapest ($40) bottle of Chardonay listed on the menu for an impromptu afternoon wine & cheese party was found to be unavailable with a call back 5 min after I ordered ..OK, let's try next one ($45) .....4 min wait on hold...No? Ok, the next one ($51) 3 min wait on hold...Nope! The cheapest bottle of Chardonnay avail from the room service staff was $65 ...What the heck!? Miffed, I canceled the whole thing and met my friends at the hotel lobby bar instead where.....the elusive $40 bottle of wine was available. I never did figure that out, but buying the whole bottle for wine and cheese party for 5 was just perfect and saved $10 bucks! Hey, I'm thrifty! 

The doormen were lovely & hailed cabs quick as a wink but the concierge gave questionable advice when looking for a place to eat steak & seafood. They recommended the Philadelphia Chart House (well known to me because of their sister properties in Annapolis & Baltimore) but the reviews on Yelp for this one were HORRIBLE! We ended up going to the Capital Grille (see my review) that was just amazing.

The walk from the hotel to the largest Terrace Ballroom going through the Convention Center is a LONG TREK! Like 5 blocks all inside & lovely but far, far, away! The Reading Terminal Market is also nearby with stalls of food & other delectable just make sure to keep your purse zipped & secured - a friend of mine had her wallet stolen whilst there this week...and that was just a shame!

WIRELESS Internet was NOT FREE & had some odd charges but it was fast & reliable. I'm still mystified how the Hampton Inn can a offer free brekkie and free wireless but fancy shmancy places like this can't or....don't.

All in all my 7 nights at the Marriott Downtown were great. Clean hotel, nice refurbished rooms, LOVED having HBO for my True Blood & Game of Thrones fix and staff that really - if approached with a warm smile, were gracious & accommodating! Thank you!

Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,Indianapolis,3.0,"Not giving 2 stars because the towels are soft, they provide lots of fluffy pillows and the bed is comfy.. What truly disappointed me about this hotel is the lack of care regarding a request I made.. I always put out the 'do not disturb' sign when staying multiple nights (in this case 3) as I don't need the cleaning crew going through my room.. Hate having strangers clean up and rearrange my stuff without me being present. No sign in my room; requested it before heading to the work conference in the hotel. Reassured by the front desk person, Rose, it was on its way. I requested nicely to not have my room cleaned and thanked her for getting the sign to my room. Well, the sign didn't come and when I got back to my room they had come in and cleaned my room. Furious I called the front desk, expressed my anger and frustration for Rose not taking my request seriously.. Felt my privacy was invaded. Finally a sign was provided.
Had a brief rude interaction with a women at the front desk (tues, may26th @ 7:30am so the hotel can possibly know who it was) when I had asked her to please not have my room cleaned (same morning as my call to the front desk; they never provided a sign so followed up with her before my conference started). She made no eye contact and scuffed at me.. Thanks hotel staff person for making me feel like my request wasn't worth your attention. Sorry I'm not important. 
Finally, it's 11:30pm, Thurs May 28th and a very loud drilling has gone on for the last two hours!
I called the front desk and was told to 'deal with it' & 'we have no control over it'. Again, with an attitude. Wasn't going to add that to this review but 2hrs of this drilling noise is ridiculous! You have multiple conferences going on in your hotel, my company alone has 75 people staying at this hotel and you want me to 'deal with it' and had trouble bringing me a 'do not disturb sign' nor ensure my room wasn't cleaned..

The Marriott is considered a 4 star hotel by Priceline, and that is what I am giving them in this Yelp review. The hotel was extremely well located for our visit as we were doing an eating and drinking crawl mostly centered around 12th and Sansom. I found our room to be perfectly adequate with the only quibble being a little bit of peeling paint in the bathroom above the shower. The shower itself was in an outdated bathtub surrounded by really outdated tile. It was clear that most of the bathroom had been updated sometime in the past 10 years, but they just ignored the tub and tile. Oh well. My wife did tell me that the whole hotel is going to have a major uplift soon, so maybe they'll get that. 

The bed was extremely comfortable (the mattress was neither to soft nor too firm), but the sheets, oddly enough, seemed slightly too small for the king bed. The decor of the room was fitting for a 4 star, not too opulent and not too blah. I enjoyed it. Ice machines were well located to all rooms on our floor, which came in handy as we had brought a bottle of bubbly.  I think we walked by 3 of them?

Four Points by Sheraton Suites Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,5.0,"I can't believe this place doesn't have a higher rating!

I have stayed at plenty of hotels throughout my travel, and the service at this one definitely tops all other experiences. From the check in, which was seamless, even though it was early, all the way to the check out and ride to the airport, the service was stunning. 

The shuttle drivers were all incredibly (two different ones, both more than amicable). The servers at the restaurant left a carafe of coffee at my table for refills, but still dropped by periodically throughout the meal to refill it for me. 

When I arrived at the airport, I called the hotel to inquire about the shuttle, and it was at the airport door within 15 minutes of my call. 

I am accustomed to being more or less ignored at hotels, because not only am I a 20-something, I look much like a teenager. I have never been treated with more respect from a hotel staff than at this location. 

Aside from the great service, the facilities were clean and orderly. The room size was proportional to price, without being too expensive.

JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,4.0,"To quote a famous politician we all know, ""Let me be clear"" --- the only reason that the Starr Pass doesn't get 5 stars from me is because I reserve 5 stars for businesses with which I can find no faults whatsoever.  Bear in mind that the issues I point out are, admittedly, nit-picky.  We've stayed here 4 or 5 times now in different rooms in different parts of the resort, so I'm qualified to offer a review that's based on more than just a single experience.

First, here's what I really like about the place:

-The grounds: Talk about a gorgeous setting!  This massive resort is perched at the top of a canyon and overlooks the valley below.  It's a little rough getting up to the resort, including a jail at the bottom of the hill, but it becomes nicer and nicer the further up the road you go.  TIP: Ask for a room with a balcony that overlooks either of the pool areas, preferably the main pool.  Before you agree to a room over the lazy river pool, make sure there's not a special ""family weekend"" event planned.  One year, Nickelodeon had a weekend event that made the area SUPER LOUD.  If you can't get a balcony room (there aren't many), just be sure to get on the pool side.  The back side of the hotel overlooks the parking lot and a steep hillside.  Yep, we did that...once.

-The workout room: AWESOME!  Hands down the largest, best equipped workout room I've seen in a hotel.  It includes a bunch of free weights, various cardio machines, and a complement of Reebok cable-style machines for a complete workout.  Open 24 hrs/day for off-hour workouts.  They have complimentary towels, a water cooler, a big bowl of granny smith apples, and even complimentary earbuds for watching TV while doing cardio.  TIP: Seems busiest right before dinner (3-5 pm).

-The staff: Haven't had a negative experience with staff yet.  Everyone seems friendly and helpful, from bellhops to valets to front desk staff.  I know, I know, you should be able to take this for granted these days, but we've all experienced rude staff, even at the nicest resorts.


Here are a few (minor) criticisms:

-The rooms: The Deluxe rooms are clean, elegant, and well-maintained.  That being said, they won't knock your socks off.  The bathrooms, in particular, don't quite hold up to other resorts I've stayed at at this price point.  I'd love to see a bathtub sized for 2, instead of a standard tub.  Ditto for the shower, which is so small you can't even get out of the water to lather up.  If a phenomenal room experience is important to you, think about stepping up to a suite.

-The location: The secluded locale is a double-edged sword.  Once your at the resort, you're AT THE RESORT.  Your 10 minutes or so to South Tucson and the closest off-site restaurant, and closer to 30 if you like to do things in the north foothills or Encantada area.  Some people never leave the grounds when they vacation, while others like to be in the middle of it all.  If you fall into the latter crowd, you should explore your options on the north side of town, such as the Westin La Paloma.

Overall, this is a great resort that we enjoy visiting every spring.",0.20425410277105194
Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"I give this hotel one star ONLY for housekeeping.  And by that I mean our room was clean.  There were only two towels in it though, and we had two adults and two kids.
My problems started before I even got there.  We were travelling from out of town for a wedding.  There was a block of rooms we could reserve from at a discounted rate so naturally I took advantage of this.  When I called the Wednesday before we would be checking in (on a Saturday) to check on my reservation and request we be placed on the same floor as others, they mysteriously had lost my reservation.  So I did another one, but SHOCKER, the blocked room rate had expired.  So now I was having to pay $100 more a night.  I was seriously pissed.   My children were in the actual wedding and this is the hotel where all the getting ready was happening so I didn't have much of a choice to stay elsewhere, plus, everywhere else close was booked.  No apologies, I was even called ""Cheap"" and suggested I stay at the ""motel 6 by the airport"" and hung up on.  I finally got a room reserved at $239 a night.  Ugh.  

Upon check in, the valet guy was EXTREMELY rude to me.  I had my son with my and my daughter and husband were at a relatives home.  We had gone to check in and get everything settled so we wouldn't have to do it later.  I told him I was just checking in and would be back in 5 minutes, if he wanted to go park the car just to turn around and go get it then that was entirely up to him.  I was told that if I was checking in then I would need to stay at the hotel.   Excuse me?

At the front desk I encountered Jessica.  I asked about being on the same floor as our other family members and rather than admit  had made a mistake and had NOT noted our accounts as previously requested, she simply told me that my relatives had cancelled their stays.......   Whatever

The room was...ok.  The beds were comfy and things seemed clean.  There were only two towels.  TV worked intermittently.   There is no vent in the bathroom so when you take a hot shower everything fogs up immediately and gets very hot and steamy.  This is what we believe is the cause of the wallpaper we found in the living area to be peeling and covered in mold.  

I had called Saturday around 7:30 for extra towels and a couple blankets because my kids were camping out on the floor.   After an hour passed, I called again.  It took almost two hours.  Then the next morning I had a message saying they were trying to deliver my towels and blankets and that they got no answer at our door so they left them outside the door.  Which was just a straight lie.   First of all, why would you deliver those things the morning after I needed them?  2nd, there was nothing outside my door, and when you say you came by and knocked, we were all there.  They didnt even realize that, even though late, someone had made it up there the night before.   Again, whatever.

The pool......  Sure.  there is a cute little indoor pool.  It is tiny, which is fine.   People dont travel to this hotel to play in the pool.  It is a nice little amenity, but not necessary.  But if you are going to have a pool, for the love of Pete, take care of it.  Water was absolutely disgusting.  My daughter who is just over 3 feet was standing in the water and I couldnt even see her feet.  The pool deck is made out of the most ridiculous tile that might as well be a sheet of ice when it gets wet.  I cannot tell you how many people fell just walking on the surface, including myself, who didnt even get in the pool, and both of my kids.  Walking, not running.  The towels they leave out for you, which again, is a nice bonus, had holes in them and I am not sure the last time they had been washed was.

The hallways and lobby of this hotel are not air conditioned.   It was 95 degrees over the weekend.  Getting ready for a wedding, going in between rooms and getting kids ready, was a disaster in the heat.  Why on earth you can't spring for AC in the hallways I will never understand.   Also, the vending/ice room, hotter than hades.  

Checkout sucked.  They tried to charge me for things that were not mine, like bottles of wine, souvenir mugs, a bunch of crap that didn't belong to me.  Valet was rude, once again.

The final charge that came out of my credit card was over $600 and I am still not even sure what for.  What was supposed to be a $300 room stay turned into double that, and a horrible experience.  I think it is safe to say that we will never ever stay in this hotel ever again.  

Oh and we saw mice in the hallway as well.  :)",0.05443121693121694
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,5.0,"My stay here this weekend was amazing. I came in Friday night, my friend arrived Thursday. Our experience was great.

The guy in valet (tall white guy on duty today 7-30-17, told me a different amount. We expressed to him we were misinformed. He was extremely rude in explaining their policy as if I knew. He lied about it being posted in attempt to make us look like fools, in which there was NO paying of it. Instead of apologizing for the misinformation and/or getting someone in management, he continued to over talk and down talk us. I expressed to him I was not questioning or challenging their policy, I was upset at the fact of being misinformed. He was not respectful of the situation at all. My friend covered the difference, in which that part wasn't an issue. The issue is, as a representative of this company, he refused to acknowledge, own, and apologize about the mixup...but yet decided to ignore the issue and over talk me.

Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,3.0,"I have stayed here a couple times, and have mostly had a great experience. The actual hotel administration and staff are helpful, accommodating, and have more than earned my respect. However, a recent experience at the hotel bar, 'Circ', has left me a bit...peeved.

To frame the narrative, I was there one night during a convention. The lobby was bustling, and the alcohol was flowing. I was just starting my night, and had ordered a single beer from a nice bartender. Going for my next round, I positioned myself at the opposite, less crowded side of the bar. I proceeded to stand there quietly, accordingly waiting to be served.

I knew things were busy, but I noticed that the bartender in that area kept passing over me, not acknowledging my existence at all. After a while I got the feeling it wasn't just because the place was busy; I was deliberately being ignored. I remained fast, and the internal timer was reaching almost half an hour. It sounds ridiculous that someone would wait that long, but I'm a person of principle. Eventually an older woman came up next to me, and when she was propositioned, she asked for a glass of wine, but then was nice enough to tell him that I had been waiting longer and should be served first. The bartender paused, then leaned in to me and snarked ""Just so you know, this is what happens when you don't take care of your bartenders."" 

It caught me completely off guard. All I could reply with was ""...huh?"" and then he turned away to pour the woman's glass of wine. I sort of stood there, dumbfounded. Another younger woman at my other side looked at me with an ""Is he serious?"" face, and I mimicked it back.

Now, I completely understand how tipped employment works, and have a lot of empathy for the strenuous work it entails. I am NOT Mr. Pink, and normally leave a very generous tip after being served. In regards to bar settings, I will usually start to tip on the second beer, or if I firstly order a mixed drink that requires preparation, or order multiple drinks at once. But..I hadn't even been served by this man yet. I'm not some snooty, pretentious partier. I wasn't asking for him to move heaven and earth...only for him to crack open a single bottle of beer. 

Logically, I can only figure a couple scenarios: One, my first bartender was upset that I didn't tip, and then colluded with this other one. I find that to be unlikely, because he didn't seem at all upset with me and was very amicable. Two, the bartender in question profiled that I had exact change in my hand, and assumed that I wasn't going to tip him. I did have exact change, because why would I break a large bill when I have the exact amount? I don't hand over the tip until I've been served, where I'll go back into my wallet and leave it on the bar. I had plenty of money to be spent at the bar that night, both for drinks and tips. In fact, I entirely planned on ""taking care"" of him for the (unrealized) sale. It seems like whatever chip on his shoulder this guy had, he lost out on a lot of money both for himself AND the business who employs him. This complaint is less about tipping protocol...more the passive-aggressive, condescending manner that he treated a paying customer. Unfortunately, a bad employee reflects upon the establishment.

I turned around and walked straight out of the lobby, gave the money I would have spent to the homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk outside the hotel, and went to drink at a real bar.

So, if you want to stay at the Marriott Downtown Philadelphia, it's a great hotel. Just avoid the bar like the plague, go somewhere that's worth the money.

They did absolutely nothing or even attempt to make the situation any better, they were content with how upset I was and nonchalant about my concerns. Rooms were ok, but walls were thin and could hear every knock and chatter in the hallways. Service at the pools took a while, at least 2-3 times around the lazy river before drinks were brought out. The floors were sticky and trash everywhere, even in the lazy river. The waiter the next morning at the buffet restaurant, was never in sight. Had to go grab our own menus.

Every employee I spoke to and dealt with were very nice, extremely pleasant and really accommodating.  I wouldn't have blamed them if they were rude...the hotel was the host of something that brought in HUNDREDS of teenage girls (ages 12-17)  from around the country.  THEY WERE EVERYWHERE!  All over the lobby, restaurant, front desk, waiting at the elevator, in the elevator, running the halls, screaming, hugging, yelling, talking, giggling, crying....one employee told me that there was one employee to every 100 teenage girls in the hotel.  The tortured look in each one of the employees eyes was hilarious because they all kept the smile on there faces the entire time...even a housekeeper supervisor that I ran into in the elevator.  

She smiled and asked how I was, but she looked so exhausted I had to ask her if she was okay.  She had a piece of paper in one hand and a pen in the other and simply said, ""There is not one extra blanket or pillow in the entire hotel.  Not one!  I feel sorry for whoever's doing laundry on Friday.""   I wished her luck as she ran off the elevator.

They all did a fantastic job.  I, on the other hand, left a day early.  I was able to.  The poor, innocent employees at the Sheraton Suites in Tampa were not.  You all deserve a vacation day after all of that.  Great job!!
 
I must mention...I did not leave early because of the teenage girls.  I left early because of MY teenage boys.  I spent the entire time running around looking for them!  Suddenly they had no interest in their video games.

Oh yeah!  The beds were very comfortable, rooms clean. Restaurant had really good food and friendly service.  Front desk clerks, I wish I knew the names, a young Asian man and an adorable young lady with shoulder length hair (who went on a cruise with her parents and grandparents-and had us cracking up laughing abouti it) were especially amazing.

Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"During our stay, numerous other guests and I experienced absolutely unacceptable customer service.  Our treatment was particularly egregious because we were with a wedding party that had a block of 65 rooms and arranged a private brunch for over 100 people, spending a substantial amount of money at the hotel.
 
First, before returning to the hotel after the wedding, the family of the bride called ahead to ensure that the bar would remain open for the guests to gather.  Despite assurances that it would, the bar was shut down shortly after everyone arrived, and the head of security unceremoniously kicked everyone out of the bar and then the lobby.  While we understood that a bar has the right to set its business hours and make poor business decisions, guests had traveled from around the country to spend time together, so the gathering moved to the guest rooms.
 
Shortly thereafter, a few guests picked up alcohol to bring to the guest rooms, but were prevented from doing so by the head of security.  Indeed, the head of security even searched some guests' bags to determine whether there was alcohol in them, which he had no right to do.  I want to be perfectly clear - these were adults, well over the legal drinking age, who had rooms in the hotel, and who were not behaving rudely or in an intoxicated manner.  Further, we were explicitly told that there had been no noise complaints in the hotel. 
 
Despite our repeated requests, we were never given a straight answer as to why we could not bring the alcohol to our guest rooms (and actually, another member of the security team acknowledge that this was inappropriate).  Instead, the manager called the police and physically barred us from returning to our guest rooms.  I'm told the police arrived later and immediately left because the call was ridiculous.  Meanwhile, the receptionist was literally screaming at the father of groom.  I was unable to ascertain exactly what she was saying, but it was extremely unprofessional and uncalled for, particularly because he was speaking reasonably with her and the other hotel employees.

This place is HQ to dozens of conferences, so most people do not pick it themselves.  The hotel itself is large and poorly laid out.  If you take the wrong elevator, plan on a lengthy walk.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,There are 1 star reviews and then there are reviews in which Jasmine at the front desk offers customer service.  Imagine the worst experience you could have at the DMV and then imagine Jasmine.  She couldn't be bothered because of her boyfriend at at the front desk (check the video 3/11/16 @ 2am) when an actual paying customer needed help.  Jasmine was phenomenally rude and not helpful.

Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"I just spent the night at the Hilton on City Ave, and while the rooms were decent, the customer service was atrocious. We had a block of 65 rooms, plus a private brunch for over 100 people. The servers and front desk were nice, but the management and head of security were horrible. About 50 of us arrived back at the hotel at 12:45am and called ahead to let them know we had a large party going to the bar, where we intended to spend a quite a bit of money. We arrived and were only permitted to order one round before calling ""Last Call"". That would have been fine (but stupid on their part for turning down the business) if we hadn't been given misleading information from multiple employees. When the group went to go back to the hotel rooms, security and management asked to search our guests' bags to check for alcohol. This is a group of successful business men and women from all over the country, and we were made to feel like high school children being disciplined. The management was rude and embarrassed our family, who spent a ton of money to make this a memorable experience for our guests. They even went as far as calling the police, who turned around and left because it was obviously ridiculous. No one in our group was even out of line, got loud or made a scene.

On top of that, when I handed the Valet my ticket in the morning to get my car, it was returned to me with my front bumper FALLING OFF, as well as dents and scratches all along the side. The head of security and hotel manager had the nerve to insinuate that I had taken my car out overnight and caused the damage myself. I was at a wedding all night and did not drive. The manager refused to apologize and just said that they would be in touch. 

I have been a manager at another high end hotel for the past six years, and would be absolutely appalled if my staff ever behaved the way that multiple managers did at the Hilton. They should be ashamed of their lack of customer service. I will not be returning, and the Hilton on City Ave can expect many of these kinds of letters from our guests, as well as a bill from my insurance company.",-0.018428059395801336
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,1.0,"I don't want to sound dramatic.  Perhaps my stay was very .... Unique?  But I won't be back here ever.  My wife and I try to avoid bad experiences by staying at nicer hotels.  This is usually done by way of priceline bidding on high stars.  Anyway here are the facts of my stay.  Upon check in we entered the room only to find used soap and shampoo containers in the bathroom.  We called the front desk and they were going to fix it right away.   We got dressed to go see the city.  In our room on the floor we found another nice surprise. An empty box of condoms.  Now I'm worried about what else wasn't cleaned.  I put it next to the shampoo so the staff would take it.  We headed out for the day and on our way to the elevator we ran into the staff going to our room.  I reported the condom box and he chuckled(let's assume in disbelief).  So we scoot around Philly all day long, get back and nothing is corrected despite running into staff just feet outside our door who said he was going into our room.  I called the front desk back and they sent a cleaning crew right up who trivialized the situation.  She didn't understand that if I felt like they missed this big stuff what else did they miss?  The sheets, shower, etc...  So now the problem is fixed.  My wife and I climb into bed for a romantic evening.  About an hour later we get a knock at the door.  We choose to ignore it because of our attire.  The knock continues.  Five KnUocks over 2 minutes.  I go to the door and see it is security through the peep. I said I couldn't answer the door and to go away or call.  This is no exaggeration. He rudely demanded that I open the door immediately and showed me a universal card key machine.  I didn't want my wife busted in on so I opened the door in my underwear.  He said he needed to do lock work since I reported someone in my room.  I explained that I hadn't reported that and in my underwear he made me reexplain.  I got frustrated to him to go away and leave me alone, locked the door with chain and went back to bed.  I called the front desk and they were apologetic.  The manager couldn't believe it and insisted that he get priceline to refund my purchase.  (side note I have not yet seen that refund, but let's give them the benefit of the doubt and assume the check is in the mail).  4 am the next morning we are dead asleep. The fire alarm goes off and says to go to the stairs and evacuate.  Okay I like fire alarms to work, but here is the failing.  Someone comes on the PA and says they are investigating the alarm.  People are emptying out my floor.  I called the front desk & they had no info at all.  So we throw on clothes, and walk down 14 flights of stairs at 4am. Once outside the fire dept is there.  Certainly there is hotel staff with an update right? Wrong.  No one to be found.  So do you go into a potentially burning hotel to figure out the problem.  After a good wait that is exactly what I did.  The staff again very casually expressed that it was false, someone played with the extinguisher.  The fire dept was there by alarm.  There never was another pa announcement until someone else told the manager you should make an anouncement and I said you have people waiting outside. We went back to our room climbed into bed shut our eyes and then guess what.... That's right the security anouncement!  Just to wake you again.  Even with a potential free room, I'd chose a different spot.  The location is great though.  By the way, it was a 2 night stay.",0.030722552910052908

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"I stayed at this hotel for several days last week after driving across country. This was the worst hotel in its class of any that I have stayed in. The price is high, the rooms are small, and the bathroom is so small that you can't open or close the door easily when inside.  The bathroom counters are serious way lower than normal. The hotel is undergoing a renovation, so there is construction noise every day of the week and 1 day we had no water for one hour.

The appointments in the room are good, and the housekeeping staff does an excellent job cleaning the room.

The staff at the morning breakfast buffet was very disappointing. Some of them were helpful, but most of them ignored us. They were supposed to serve coffee, but they never came to our table. Some of them looked  like they were just trying to appear to be busy without doing any actual work even though there was a large number of staff. Overall they seemed unable to keep up with a room full of diners. Constantly  running out of food at the various stations, and not keeping the tables bussed. The guys cooking the omelettes get an excellent job, but got no support for the rest of the staff with they ran out of something.

The cost of parking was unreasonable, so it's best to go to the casino next-door, gamble for a half hour and get 24 hours of free parking.

Overall, my stay there was just OK, and for the money I would recommend staying somewhere else.",0.11527210884353742
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,3.0,"This hotel is fine.  Not a lot more, not a lot less.  Location is good depending on what you're in town to see/do.  Room was fine.  A few notes:

- When we checked in (early check in at 10am), valet was full.  There were a few events at the hotel that morning, so not only could we not park at the hotel, but all other nearby parking facilities were also full.  Most hotels do put aside a share of their parking to ensure overnight guests are accommodated, but since we were an early check in, I can't fully fault the hotel.  However...

- Some of the valet staff was downright rude.  Rather than shouting at incoming guests, why don't you try to politely tell them what you want to do.  It isn't my fault that your parking was full and everyone is trying to scramble.  To their credit, other staff were all quite friendly.

- It was in the mid 90's on the day we stayed, and the A/C for the whole hotel broke in the evening.  Now, these things happen from time to time.  But the lobby had gotten so hot that the starbucks pulled all their food because it was all melting.  They did eventually fix, and overnight the temperature came down.  Like I said, these things do happen ,but...

All together, this is an adequate hotel that may be a little too big for its staff to effectively manage, and that needs to be updated but probably won't be any time soon since downtown Philadelphia has a shortage of hotel rooms so they don't need to.",0.1569978632478633

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New Orleans,New Orleans,4.0,"First I must start off by saying that I AM a Hilton Gold so my view may be a little biased as I got upgraded, received free WIFi, and received free breakfast. Since I went during the off time, I spent about $100 a night. As far as location, it was great. Yes the rooms are small and a little dated, but for the price I paid I think it was a great value. Also their breakfast buffet was pretty tasty. I probably would stay there again if I got the same price for the room. Bourbon St was maybe a 5 minute walk and the trolley off Canal pretty much took me wherever I needed to go. The desk person was nice as well even though the guy in front of me was a weirdo and kept asking her the same question over and over and over again and she was very patient and professional with him. Every person I interacted with at the hotel was courteous as well.

Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,Indianapolis,3.0,"So I booked this room via ""Hotwire"", so my experience may be different if you were to book them directly or if you are a member of the Hilton Club perks. I couldn't complain about the price that we paid for a 4-star hotel. When my girlfriend and I arrived to the hotel, the atmosphere, the service, and appearance was 4-star for sure. Check in was very easy and multiple elevators which was a nice thing. When we get to the room, we felt that it was a ""Hotwire"" or bargain-type room because it was tucked away in the corner, and it was hard to explain, but you could tell that the hotel and the company decided if they don't get a lot of room sold, then that room we stayed was designated as the ""bargain"" room.

Well I don't want to make it sound bad, but there were just a few things that made it seem this hotel more of 3-star hotel (more so like a 2.5 star) than a 4-star. Well I haven't stayed at much of Hilton, but I was kind of bummed that they didn't have a refrigerator inside the room. Maybe it is the type of Hilton Hotel, but come one, I can get a refrigerator at a Holiday Inn or Best Western and still paid either the same price or less. There were some certain things that made the room unattractive. The biggest thing we saw was a giant stain on the wall. Didn't know if it was old coffee and maybe that was the trash can was originally located, but it was kind of gross. They had water bottles in the room, but it was like $4 per bottle! I stayed at 4-star hotel in Chicago and they had a giant bottle of water for FREE! But you know I couldn't complain since I used the room only to sleep, but it would've been nice to have at least a refrigerator in the room.

My biggest complaint about this place was the noise level. That night, there were some very ""loud"" people staying that night. I don't know how soundproof the wall is when doors are closed, but these people were very loud and very rude that they were not being considerate of their noise level. They were standing in the hallway to the rooms and even had their doors open, and they were laughing and talking very loud. I am usually a very calm and forgiving person with noise, but this was very rude. When these people decided to move their party inside the room and closed the door, it was relatively quiet, but you can still hear when they screamed and laughed out loud. We eventually had to call the front desk and maybe that did the trick because these people (who were 2 doors down from us, or almost nearly across from us), came out and started the party back in the hallway. So I am not trying to complain to the hotel, but just wanted to warn everyone that if you are a light sleeper, and if you do end up staying at this hotel, and encounter an episode like mine, please call the front desk to request for a room change. That is the only advice I could give. Yeah I know that people want to party and don't want to ruin the vibe of having a good time, but some days people forget about politeness when they are under the influence of alcohol.

Overall, the hotel was OK. It's in downtown Indy and it is near by many stores to shop, and restaurants to dine at. Parking is either a self-garage parking or valet parking; both offering in and out privilege, which is a good thing. They have a restaurant (bar and grill they call it), which offers OK food and also, they are adjoined to a McCormick and Shmick? steakhouse.

I would not recommend this place if you are booking directly through their website, unless you are one of those members who gets points for staying at the hotel. Once again,  i booked it via ""Hotwire"" and the money that I paid for the room was a bargain. I just wished it was a better experience. But hey, everyone has opinions and you can either take it or leave it.

Thanks for reading my long review and I hope you found it to be funny, helpful, or just plain awful!

When I asked that room be cleaned, the cleaning staff was very rude and huffed and puffed before storming into the room. Still did not clean nor refilled the tea supply.

Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,4.0,"If you use Priceline to book this hotel, then you'll get it for a steal. Otherwise, I feel kind of bad for the Elite and card members who most likely pay close to full price for their stay. 

The Marriott in my opinion is worth it's tag price. The location is killer and in the heart of Old Town. We were five blocks from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, one block from the infamous LOVE statue and Philadelphia town hall, and if you're feeling really walking spontaneous, a whopping nine blocks from the Museum of Art, with plenty to take in a long the walk. 

The Valet is overpriced, but we were happy with the service when we had to call for our car to get things we had forgotten right after we checked in. Most of the Valets were friendly and we were usually asked multiple times if we needed help instead of being ignored. It was nice to have the taxi cue in front instead of having to call for one. 

The Front desk is of a cold demeanor. Just ignore them. They don't want to be there and there's no changing their mind even if you get upset or get an attitude. It's honestly not going to do any good with these unhelpful species. 

The rooms are nice and in no way outdated. 

*The bed was comfy.
*The sheets were clean.

*The Hotel had wifi, but for a price. (Bummer)

Either the room was hot and stuffy or freezing - there was nothing in-between using both the temp and fan controls. Many others have complained about this - yet the hotel does nothing about it. We checked in at 5PM and were unapologetically sent to the lounge by the Front Desk Supervisor because our room was not yet ready. She told us that she would come get us in 15 minutes.

He looks at us like we are Martians and says ""yeah we are out of water"" and tells us to grab something else from the cooler by his desk.  How is a hotel out of water?  

The room was clean and the maid was nice and everything else was terrible.

Oh I almost forgot, the complimentary breakfast was brutal!!  Fake eggs,  a machine that makes pancakes that taste like rubber, bacon with fat all over it!!! That's from 7am-10am, and right at 10am the girls come out of the kitchen and take anything left from breakfast.  I saw a girl getting coffee and she turned to get the sugar and BAM!!!! the kitchen girl grabbed the coffee pot!  

NEVER, NEVER, NEVER will go back there!",-0.07321732590885818
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Do not stay here!!! 

We made reservations in January for a July stay.  I have 5 in my family and was told I needed two rooms.  I agreed and said I would need connecting rooms.  All was set until we checked in.  Upon check in I was given two room keys(one for both rooms).  Went to the rooms to find out they where not connecting.  Went back down stairs only to be told there where no connecting rooms left.  What was I to do, put my 15 year old in a room by himself?  They said ""we don't know"". After speaking with Jamie who is the front desk manager and completely rude, she also said nothing we can do.  Again I have 5 in my family and was told that a connecting room would be available when I checked in.   I asked for the next in line manager only to be told he was not there. I ended up going into sales/catering to complain.   Nicole was very nice and helped but by giving me a Cot for our family of 5 to stay in a small
Room.  I went back to my room and called to ask if they would remove the chair when they bring the cot only to be told they would not be brining a cot.  Again back to the sales office to find Nicole to straighten this mess out.  The cot was huge and we had to push the beds to both walls in order to get it down.  I woke up this morning to find that the room next to me (which would have connected to ours) was being cleaned and new people had just come in.  The cot in our room is a
complete fire hazard.  I agreed because I had no choice.  Why would this hotel
not care about the safety of the children.  Talking to other employees
In the building there was and still is a two bedroom suite
available.  Would this not have been the better option to give my family.  Obviously fire hazards are not a concern to Jamie or this establishment.  

Go to another hotel.  Really the help is rude, the
Carpets are dirty, the rooms are horrible and dusty (vents are disgusting!)",-0.04815824915824916
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,3.0,"This is my 3rd time staying at this Marriott location. I was in town for a conference across the street at the Loews and the Marriott offered a very competitive rate. The stay was pleasant. The front desk staff was very nice.  I checked in at 10:30am on a Saturday morning and was given a room right away. The staff member noticed that I was staying for 3 nights and moved me to a higher room with a view. Super nice!!
 
On the last day, there was a water main pipe break in the city, so the hotel had no water all morning. I called for assistance using the phone in my room and the person on the phone was very unapologetic, unhelpful, and just plain rude. She kept repeating that it was the city's fault and not the fault of the hotel. She must've repeated it 3 times, each time in a slower voice, as if I couldn't understand her because I couldn't speak English. I understand that it was not the Marriott's fault and understand that the staff was under a lot of pressure. But she was argumentative and rude and raised her voice with me on the phone. She could've said, simply, ""I'm very sorry for this inconvenience. There will be water bottles in the lobby for guests"". It's THAT simple. Instead, she straight up just said, with an attitude, ""I don't know what you want me to do for you"", when I asked if any kind of accommodations were being made to assist guests.
 
The front desk staff, when I got down there, was very helpful and gave me some water bottles to use to get ready for the day. I was in town for work and had to be at work and the phone staffer was very, very unhelpful. This is not the kind of customer service I have come to expect from the Marriott. The Philadelphia Marriott Downtown will continue to be my hotel of choice whenever I'm in town for work (this was my 3rd time staying with this hotel), but I felt like the situation could've been handled better.",0.1856425518925519
Four Points by Sheraton Suites Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,1.0,"I stayed here in June of this year and had the absolute worst hotel experience that I've ever had, ever. 

1. Upon arrival (after driving 13 hours in a horrible storm) we pulled out the sleeper sofa for my travel companion to sleep on to discover a large amount of dirt and pubic hair. We called to get the bed changed and since no one was available due to it being night they sent someone up with bedding. He arrived after waiting at least 20 minutes and brought the wrong items. No sheets, just a blanket. We asked him to bring the correct items and he was extremely rude. Came back a while later with a single sheet- no pillow cases, no top sheet. At this point we were too tired to deal with sending him back again, so we made due.

2. Room service took forever and they brought us the wrong food. Took even longer to correct the order.

3. I took my friend and a potential client out to breakfast in the restaurant. My friend and I ordered off the menu, my potential client got the buffet. Our waitress spilled a cup of syrup on my potential client towards the middle of the meal. She was apologetic, but then removed my plate and my friend's plates which we had not finished with. We didn't say anything because it was a very awkward situation at this point. Then a short while later my potentialclient was finishing up her meal and and were talking. She was eating a breakfast sandwich she made with items from the buffet. After setting the sandwich down a very large beetle crawled out of the middle of her sandwich. We were HORRIFIED. The waitress did NOT apologize and instead shouted across the restaurant, ""WELL I GUESS WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COMP THEIR MEALS NOW."" I was absolutely mortified. I was with a potential client and now she was covered in syrup, had experienced terrible service, and had a beetle crawl out of her food. I was pretty sure that I was going to lose this client after this all because of this awful dining experience. (Miraculously, I didn't.) A manager came over and apologized, but it was too little too late.

4. I found 3 spiders in our hotel room and left the hotel covered in bug bites by the end of the trip.

5. After the breakfast ordeal I asked to speak to the hotel manager. I explained our situation very politely and she made excuses for everything. Told me that it is Florida and most hotels have bugs. I've stayed in MANY Florida hotels and never had bug issues before. I am also very familiar with how hotels are run since my family is involved in the hotel business. I explained this to her and told her about my connection and knowledge of Sheraton Hotels. She responded disrespectfully to me. My family owns the one that is local to us, she told me that it was not possible and implied that I was making this up. She did promise to fumigate our room. This never happened and we checked out 3 days later to go stay and a different Sheraton nearby.",-0.07698059964726632
Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,Indianapolis,3.0,"The name and the lobby are not enough to make this a great hotel. We stayed in a state suite. The bathrooms were updated but that's it. While nice looking, the bathroms had issues. The shower diverter only transferred about 80% of the water to the shower head. The tub filled up quickly and was very slow to drain. They also failed to install vent fans in the bathrooms which was a hassle.

The room itself was large, with a wall of windows overlooking the city. There is a large desk in the corner facing away from the windows and not private. There is a large round table with four chairs. The living area also had a couch and two armchairs facing the entertainment center. The furniture was old looking and uncomfortable. There is a nice little wetbar with a refrigerator and coffee maker.

The sofa folds out into the single worst possible surface you could imagine sleeping on, outranked even by armchair and floor. Sleeping on a chicken wire hammock would be preferable. They also failed to include extra pillows for this option.

The master bedroom has its own bathroom, a nice king bed and closes off from the rest of the room.

If you have to entertain and do business, it might meet your needs.

Even with the overly expensive price for what you get, they have plenty of upcharges. Internet access for example among others like $22/day for parking and half the breakfast options. The parking garage is open air and you have to walk outside from the hotel to get to it. There was an issue of a misquoted price for the service from the front desk, with the attendant being rude about it. They do offer valet for an upcharge.

Basic breakfast is free with voucher, but if you want hot food, and some drinks, it costs extra. You also have to wait for their incredibly slow service to get drinks and wait to check out (even if you get the free voucher).

For the price, I was quite disappointed.",-0.0035744810744810806
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,1.0,"This is easily the worst Marriott property I have ever stayed in.  I have been a loyal Marriott customer for many years. I have stayed with them all around the world and in almost every major city in this country. This property is not what I have come to expect. The front desk woman was incredibly rude. She was giving me attitude when I was just trying to check in.  The room was dirty. Dust on the night tables. Dust in the glasses. Usually the glass ware comes in plastic for sanitary reasons, this didn't. The ceiling had paint chipping and falling down. Clearly the bathroom has poor ventilation and no one has bothered to perform normal maintenance. There was also no blow dryer or bathrobe. My Marriott profile states extra towels and a refrigerator. There were only 2 towels with brown spots on them and no refrigerator. My room was also never serviced. If you call for anything in the hotel the phone just rings and rings and rings. I am still waiting for a call back from the manager. At the moment it has been 4 hours. The concierge doesn't seem to know anything about Philadelphia. I asked for a jewelry store in the area to have my watch battery changed. She told me a location but didn't know the name. There was no jewelry store there but there is one almost across the street from the hotel. It's really irritating since that is her job.
The rooms are like every other Marriott except this one has incredibly thin walls and doors. You can here it anytime someone walks passed your room.
The only thing nice here is the concierge floor. The night time service is phenomenal . The gentleman stopped me before I left t to make sure I got some chocolate cake he was just putting out.",-0.019625603864734296
DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"The hotel itself is just fine. Great location. Nothing fancy, all the essentials. I will say that when we got here the shower hot water was running and would not shut off. That was fixed when we talked with the front desk. The restaurant/breakfast buffet which is doubletree is what is getting a one star rating. Normally I would not rate an entire hotel a one star just based on an experience with one part of the hotel, but I was so disturbed by the lack of friendliness, professionalism and helpfulness. I've worked in restaurants before and have put on large scale events, and never have I ever seen such a lazy group of people as well as people who just really have no business working with people. The first day here we tried to have breakfast but at 10:45am were told that they stopped serving already even though people were still getting food from the buffet. Breakfast was supposed to be served until 11am. Today when coming down to get the buffet at 10:30am. There were several people waiting and there were THIRTEEN tables of varying sizes available. Then we were told there would be a 15-20 minute wait. While waiting and watching the staff move as slow as molasses, a family complained about there being tables available and needing to eat before they get on a plane home. Then we watched as the hostess slowly walked to clean a table for them as slow as humanly possible. Then she sat the group. When we also said the same thing she went and cleaned off another table and sat us. A server overheard us complaining and stated that the reason there was such a wait was because all of the staff was lazy. He was the only friendly person who did seem to enjoy what he was doing. The food was cold and not that tasty but it was free. Except it wasn't, we recieved a bill for over $40 and they said that it was not free, but that only the continental breakfast was free. Apparently the two serving areas for the buffet were seperate (even though there was no sign and they were next to eachother). When we got the manager to speak with him, he was rude and unapologetic and seemed annoyed that he had to speak with customers and said that we would have to pay the full amount, We explained that the hostess and waitress asked if we had breakfast vouchers and when we said that we did they said to help ourselves to the buffet. We had to go to the front desk to have them waive any fees because the manager refused. They agreed that there was a mistake. When I tried to help improve their process and customer service by suggesting that they explain that to you when you are waiting to be seated and that they post signs designating the area the manager Dustin just said very rudely okay and then walked away. I can honestly say that these are the things that make me never want to stay at a Doubletree again. Providing friendly service and wanting to help people is clearly not apart of any training or requirement of staff. And I have never been at a restaurant with an issue where the manager flat out says we are wrong and doesn't try to help and make the situation better. And we were not wrong which is the most frustrating part. I think with better management this could change but when a manager is rude and clearly hates his job, the staff will follow suite. Being friendly and courteous is really not that hard to do, or that much to expect from people in the service industry.",0.09091630591630592
Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,Indianapolis,1.0,"Spent $430 for a two night stay on Friday and Saturday. Ridiculously high but didn't really have any other options. The only thing good about this hotel was the location. Perfect for downtown activities but that's about it. Bed and pillows were super comfy but they cover the comforter with a top and bottom sheet so it's tucked in between. Waking up in the morning to see the comforter was not a pretty sight. It was a gross brown color with lots of orange stains. It also didn't have a fridge or microwave. You have to request them both if, and only if, they are available. They weren't. It's also kind of annoying to only have one small trash can in the bathroom and none in the actual room which was a king with a sofa, so it was bigger room. Also called about a continental breakfast because thinking how much I spent that has to be included, right? Wrong. I call and ask if there is a continental breakfast and the woman says yes but it's an extra charge. ‍ Thats not a continental breakfast.The staff when we checked in was nice but they told me I was booked under two separate rooms when I booked everything together so I had to come to the front desk to rescan my room keys. Handed the guy the two keys and only gave one back while my friend and I were both standing there. Told him we both needed a key and he was rude about the whole situation. PARKING! This is crap. If I'm spending over $430 to stay at this hotel, parking should not be an extra charge. That's absurd. The garage is attached to the hotel so why charge extra for the guest.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Tucson - Reid Park,Tucson,1.0,"I am a Hilton Honors member.  I've stayed at countless Doubletree Hotels on business.  This one is not up to Doubletree or Hilton standards.

So, when it came to my wedding weekend (pre-honeymoon) - I booked 3 days here while my family stayed at my house.  It is conveniently located around the corner from my house, and although I thought $155/night was a little steep, I went for it.  On Friday, I entered the room (outside entrance, ala motor lodge) and immediately stopped at the front door - the tile looked as though mud had been tracked all across it and I thought they had accidentally sold me a dirty room.  Got down on my hands and knees - nope, no dirt, just really ugly tile.  Hope they got a good deal on it.  Ok.  Get my computer set up - oh, neat - no outlet by the desk.  That's ok, I just fished behind the mini fridge for the power strip - had to unplug a lamp, but I did get the internet hooked up (after I paid the 5.95 fee - which I am accustomed to, but usually in much nicer places).  Ok.  Time to shower.  Holes in my towels when I went to dry off.  Classy.  Operator was rude when I called for a shuttle from the airport for my guest.

In the morning.  Breakfast at the Cactus Rose.  Mediocre.  Server apparently not accustomed with patrons not ordering off the menu (there is a buffet).  Looked at my companion strangely when she asked for a silverware set-up.  Never could find him to get a to-go container, so just took my half-eaten burrito back to the room (was hoping my other friend would want it when she woke up).  Well, she left it there (since there was no microwave to heat it up) and there it stayed for the next two days - housekeeping never did remove it.  Now, I DO leave tips for housekeeping staff, but it did not seem to matter.

Wedding night.  Returned to hotel.  Only one towel present in room (but it did not have any holes, so that was good).

This hotel was a huge disappointment.  I was embarrassed that I suggested it to my out of town guests, several of which stayed there as well.

On a side note, we honeymooned in Bisbee and stayed at Letson Lofts FOR THE SAME PRICE and had a 5 STAR experience...",-0.018204365079365077
JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"Where do I begin... I took my fiancé there for her birthday with the kids, it was supposed to be a perfect getaway for us and the kids. I had called ahead to book my room and talked with the front desk, upon arrival I went to the front desk to check and I got this rude lady that didn't want to give me my room key, she said I would have to get a different room and that it would cheaper but I wouldn't get everything in the original package I got. I refused and wanted the correct room with my complementary breakfast, after hassling with her for about 30 minutes, she finally gave me my room key, with an ignorant look on her face. We got to the room thinking everything was al settled. We get to the hallway leading to our room and it was dreadful, they were doing renovating or something, nasty mattresses were in the hallway and microwave and our room was ALL THE WAY IN THE BACK, we open the door and it was the most disgusting room ever. There were stains on the wall, bugs flying around I swear there was a stain that looked like blood on the wall as well. We called the front desk demanding a new room and they said they were gonna send someone up and we waited. About 45 minutes later no one was sent up, so we took matters into our own hand and went to the front desk and demanded a new room. After hassling once more, we finally got a room with a good view and no stains or bugs. After about an hour we put our bathing suits on and went down to the pool, after swimming we went to the patio and sat down to eat at the ""Salud"" restaurant. After sitting down and waiting to get served , our waiter comes back with some work uniforms and stated that we cannot wear bathing suits in the restaurant, we were clearly outside in the patio eating, which is part of the pool area and not single sign stated no bathing suits. We Decided to go to room and change and then we came back down. Tell me why a whole family in bathing suits was eating perfectly unbothered, they had kids and the adults were wearing bikinis. We waited for the waiter to speak to them as well about the policy and nothing was said! When the food arrived we spoke to the waiter as to why we were singled out for wearing bathing suits when a couple tables over a whole family was clearly not dress properly. He stated his boss made him enforce the policy and would go speak with the family, we kindly asked him not too and demanded an explanation as to why nothing was said to them when they first arrived. He looked like a total deer in headlights, soon after he got his boss out there and he apologized for the inconvenience and said he would work with us in getting our money back and that he feels bad about the situation. We didn't care about the money but we felt totally attacked, as to why we were kicked out for wearing bathing suits when other families were not. A couple minutes later, the waiter comes back crying to us apologizing for the whole situation and said he would get our room paid for, and tab taken care of. He was straight up crying, I had to put everything aside and hug him in front of everyone and hoped he wouldn't let it affect the rest of his day, after a couple hugging sessions we finally left and I was in total shock of all the unprofessional staff working here. We are a Hispanic family as well and later that evening they waiter comes back with a churro to apologize, out of all the deserts on the menu he decided a churro, it's probably an overstatement, but all the flames just began to rise again. For almost $300 to stay at that resort we stand a majority of our stay fighting with the staff over unprofessional behavior and a disgusting hotel room. We were promised a full refund on our room and have yet to even receive it, we've contacted them several times and  no action is being taken, there is no communication what so ever.

I can forgive the hotel for giving away the fourth room we booked on accident because they fixed the mistake. What I cannot and will not put up with is rude staff. Mohammed (night shift) I told him that the rooms advertised two queens and it was two fulls. He seemed agitated already and told me that if we pushed the two full beds together that it would make a queen. Not only is that not scientifically possible but I was baffled by the suggestion. I understand that you don't need a diploma to work at the Hilton but this is common sense. I remained polite and asked for a cot to be brought up, he said we have no cots. I said okay can I get some extra pillows at least and he said you can't have five people to a room??? We only had four total. He was just insulting me at this point.

TownePlace Suites by Marriott New Orleans Downtown/Canal Street,New Orleans,1.0,"The first night we had a false fire alarm and instead of notifying everyone via intercom as everyone was coming down the stairs the night manager was standing there saying it's a false alarm. The use of the intercom system would have been great instead of greeting us at the bottom of the stairs. Finally so many people complained then the intercom was used. The message was stated so rudely over the intercom. Day 2- I used the valet service and when I received my vehicle that morning as I was driving tons of black ant looking bugs was coming through my vent system. My boyfriend called the hotel to speak with management and to be told that the valet was managed by another company. The manager name was Mr. Henderson. I drove back to the hotel valet and asked to speak to the manager and another man was in valet said he was the supervisor. I told him come look all these bugs coming through my vents. He proceeded to say ""I told dem boys don't park the cars on the first f$&king row"" and then he apologized and said they will remove the valet charge from my bill. So I parked my car in the park lot next door to the hotel for the next 2 nights. I couldn't drive my vehicle to the event on Friday night because there were bugs invading my car. Now, I'm inconvenience because of your selected valet services and had to use a Uber to go to my event. My boyfriend spoke with Mr. Henderson and wanted me to email him a written statement about the bugs. Really???!!! This will not solve my invading bug car situation now. I needed assistance immediately. Checkout morning, I had a feeling that the valet charge was not removed like I was told so has I checked out that valet charge was still there. This sent me over the edge. The young lady at the front removed the charges for the valet after I explained for the 3rd time about the bugs in my vehicle. So as we are leaving the hotel, one of the bellmen helped us with our luggage to the car next door and he asked why we didn't use valet and I told him about the bugs invading in my car. He said ""oh they will pay for the extermination"". So this is nothing new and has happened to other customers. I live in Dallas, TX and needed to get back home. There was no time to have my vehicle exterminated in New Orleans. So my drive back was horrible. I took my vehicle into the Mercedes Benz dealership here and $421.00 later I had to pay to have my ventilation system cleaned. I have a snapshot of actually where my vehicle was parked because my vehicle was set in valet protection mode which sending messages and signals to my phone. This is an overall reflection of your hotel even if you don't manage the valet services. It's went all downhill with false fire alarm and seeing blood on the lobby flood from someone who beaten up in the lobby for ""supposedly"" not paying his tab at the bar or he pulled the fire alarm has he ran out the building. But we were told a dryer overheated setting off the fire alarm. So I don't know the truth but it was horrible.

JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"I hate giving this resort one star because it came so highly recommended and is insanely beautiful. I grew up in Tempe, went to NAU and had so many of my friends went to the UofA, so it was wonderful seeing another side of Tuscon. We live in Orange County and our middle son is a Sophomore at the UofA. Last year I was unable to get a hotel so I made a reservation at Starr Pass a year in advance. I do not normally make our travel reservations because my husband travels for business and he does this for us. During that year my e-mail shut down and my BofA Debit card, which I used to make my reservation, was compromised a countless amount of times so I did not have a confirmation number or credit card to look up my reservation. I called Starr Pass to explain my situation and confirm my reservation which is where my nightmare began!! Who knew?! AND, AT NO POINT DID ANYONE, INCLUDING A MANAGER ON DUTY, MAKE MY SITUATION ANY EASIER FOR ME! I explained three times my e-mail was down and was told all three times to bring my confirmation number with me when I checked in. I gave up. My husband and I travel a lot! My husband travels for work and stays in Marriotts as a Gold Elite member. We both love Marriott hotels and until now have never had any problems communicating our needs. After many calls and speaking with many different employees I was finally able to confirm my reservation. Thank God! I then explain that I needed to put my reservation on my husbands credit card and Gold Elite membership. My husband was traveling to Australia on business so I would be going to Family weekend by myself. I am told that they were unable to do either requests for me. My husband then has to call and they agree. I call back..AGAIN! I am told I need to fax my authorization form to her right right away. I do not have a fax machine, along with most of America in 2018, so I e-mail her the form immediately asking her in e-mail to confirm that she received it. I check my e-mail before my drive from Orange County to Tuscon but do not hear back from her. I check my e-mail twice on the drive and leave a message on her voice mail but still do not hear from her. When I check in on Friday, October 5, 2018, I am told they do not have my authorization form and the women at the desk tells me they can not use my hard copy or take my husband's Marriott Gold Elite card because he is not traveling with me. I ask to speak to a manager and FINALLY A COMPETENT EMPLOYEE! The manager checks me in, takes my husbands credit card and Marriott Gold Elite card. My husband sends me a text stating that his card was charged for two nights stay. When I checked in I told the women at the desk I would like to stay a third night, on Sunday night which I also put in writing on my hard copy authorization form and in the e-mail I sent that was never returned. After getting my husband's text I called the front desk and tell the women I would like to stay on Sunday night. I ask what the rate is and she gives me the same rate as Friday and Saturday night. I ask her why the rate is the same and she tells me that it is because it is UofA's Family weekend and that is their Family Weekend rate. I tell her that Sunday night is not included in Family weekend because when I checked in and the women at the front desk told me that all the families leave on Sunday and it would be very quite for me Sunday night and Monday morning. I also tell her that I was on the Starr Pass web site and their web site rate is much less then what she is quoting me. She tells me there rates have never ever been that low so I tell her to look on the Starr Pass web site, which she does, and then, and only then, does she tell me that she will honor the lower rate. WHAT? Thanks? I guess? I get off the phone with her and get another call from the desk saying I need to come and get my new keys since I am staying an additional night. I tell her I am about to leave for the UofA game and don't have time and shouldn't need new keys since I was staying in the same room, it was Saturday and if they were going to change my keys they could do so Sunday. She is so rude to me that I ask to speak to a manager. She is the manager. I have had it! I ask to speak to her manager, who ends up being the same gentlemen who helped me when I checked in. I tell him how upset I am and he tells me to go enjoy the game and he will check in with me the next day. I never hear from him. I stay three nights and never once get my room cleaned, not once, ordered room service, ate and drank at the bar and restauran,t and valeted my car (tipping each time I came and went). I HAD THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AFTER SPENDING THAT MUCH MONEY! I WILL NEVER STAY AT THE STAR PASS AGAIN! EVER! I would recommend anyone and everyone finding another place to stay as well. There are so many great places to stay in Tuscon. There is no need to spend a fortune for horrible service! We will forever love Marriotts, just not this one!",0.07308458123509143
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,5.0,"This place has all your basic top notch hotel features. Giant suite rooms. Beautiful balconies, with a great view. A nice pool, to relax or party in. A crazy church group right outside your hotel room, ranting for several hours that want to ruin your fun.

Oh, your not a fan of a crazy church group right outside your hotel room, ranting for several hours that want to ruin your fun? Well trust me, they're quite hilarious. 

The Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter is a great spot to stay if you're looking for a party hotel in New Orleans. You're pretty much right in the middle of all the action. It's on Bourbon Street. They got huge balconies. Parties by the pool. And best of all, Deja is always around. She's like the hotel mascot. A hideous hideous mascot.

I came here for a huge bachelor party and I had the pleasure of being in the suite. Sharing it with five other people, most of which who snored. And we had everyone party in my room. Yippie.....   This was the place to be though.

Upon arrival the front desk was super friendly and helpful. I had been in New Orleans before, but they gave me some more recommendations which were helpful. 

The suite was huge. Two rooms, had two queen beds, two cots, lots of chairs and room to spare. Plenty of room for urgh ummm............. dancing. Yes that will do, random women dancing. The balcony overlooked Bourbon Street and we were on the second floor. 

My friends enjoyed throwing beads at people for several hours at a time. I'd say once every two hours, some sad sad drunk girl with low self esteem would actually flash her breasts. Then be rewarded with beads that cost five cents. I enjoyed tossing my beads at the church group much better. We played who can get the beads on the giant cross. Most of them ignored us, but one girl jumped, caught them and then proceeded to break them while giving us a mean look. That got me more aroused than any girl flashing us that weekend. They stayed for about two hours each night. I also threw a buck at a bum. He was so happy, he tossed me a Bourbon Street t-shirt. It was most likely stolen, it had tags still on it. Thanks, dude!

I was lucky enough to take advantage of the pool. It was originally going to rain all weekend, but it was real nice my final full day. Got to the pool, grabbed a lawn chair and started drinking some buds. I was going heavy, after all I was on vacation. Got packed for a bit and it was good crowd. Good mix of people, getting drunk, partying and playing with a giant inflatable penis. Some college aged kids began playing catch with a giant thing of pineapple juice. When one idiot got hit in the head with it and let it fall to the bottom, none of them could manage to recover it. Despite my feelings that pineapple juice belongs where no one should ever drink it, I dove in and grabbed it. I felt the hotel deserved better than that. In fact, it deserves more. 

Thank you Four Points Sheraton French Quarter. You provided us with shelter and warmth one crazy crazy weekend. 

By the way, has anyone seen my friend's shoe? He's missing it. If you find it, please let me know. Thanks.",0.15932943153337895
Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,3.0,"The hotel was beautiful and the beds were comfortable. However, I was disappointed by the customer service at both the front desk and the valet. The man at the front desk was a bit rude and the valet forgot to get our car (which we realized after waiting over 15 minutes). I saw some other interactions and the staff just wasn't as welcoming as I would have expected. The housekeeping was very nice, as was the lady in charge of housekeeping staff and arranging for rollaway beds. One point to mention is that housekeeping came around and knocked at 9am, which is a bit early, especially because we had specifically requested late check-out. We should have put a do-not-disturb sign on the door; however, we felt that housekeeping wasn't even going to come that early especially because we were checking out in a few hours. That wasn't a problem though, just something I wanted to mention.",0.03499999999999999

I was moved due to they weren't able to fix my shower head or water pressure. I asked the night operator and she said I only needed to to move down the hall but had to go down to first floor cross the lobby to other side. As someone who works at resort, I was extremely disappointed in Marriott for poor execution of dealing with my situation. Also my server at lobby bartender was rude and lied that we can't pay with credit card and only due room Charge when she charged table next to us with credit card....... very nice hotel but poor associate training.......",-0.048950617283950615
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,1.0,"This Marriott left me extremely disappointed. Our flight arrived early so we went straight to the hotel (around 10 am) with our baby. We went to the Elite desk to check in. She told us someone would call us as soon as our room was ready. So we waited at the lobby. We went to Reading Terminal Market for lunch, came back and waited again. My husband went to check but nothing was ready so we waited in the lobby again. While waiting I became friends with a lady who was there for a conference. We got to talking and this was past 3 pm. She was very surprised that we are Platinum Elite members and were made to wait this long. Frustrated my husband went to check again. This time it was someone else at the Elite desk and she told us, ""oh your room has already been ready for more than an hour. Have you not been called?"" We were extremely taken aback as they could see us waiting with a fussy baby right in their lobby and no one bothered to let us know. We didn't receive a single apology. 

My husband's Marriott profile requests a quiet room away from the elevator since he is a very light sleeper. Upon check in, he asked the front desk if our room was way from an elevator and the person checking us in confirmed that it was. Upon entering the room we found the wall bordering the elevator shaft, and every time the elevator moved, it was like a freight train passing by. My husband called the front desk and requested a room change, he was told that there were no rooms available and that they would move us the next day. Needless to say no one called the next day and when my husband called to check he was told that a manager would call him back. No one called. 

On the last day, we were granted permission to checkout at 4 pm. My husband had left a Do Not Disturb Sign, at the door while my baby and I was resting. Around 11 am, there was a really loud knock, I answered asking who is there, two more loud knocks and someone just opens our room, enters, turns the lights on and leaves. I thought that was extremely rude, and a huge violation of our privacy, since we had a Do Not Disturb Sign right on the door. I called front desk to let them know what happened. The lady who answered was really nice and apologetic and told me that shouldn't have happened. She wanted me to speak to the housekeeping manager. She came back on line and told me that manager wasn't available and she was transferring me to a different manager. A manager named Alex came on the line and I explained what happened. He told me he didn't know who entered my room but he could get security up there and see whose card was swiped. I told him to please let me know. I never received a call back. 

This is without a doubt the most none guest friendly hotel with the worst customer service that we have ever stayed in. One thing we noticed, none of the staff was smiling! I would really like to give this hotel a O star but unfortunately that is not an option.",0.05595238095238096
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"Pros: The hotel beds, linens, and rooms are nice compared to the other Four Points I've stayed at in New Jersey and compared to the average hotel.  The room, so long as the window faces the parking structure/pool area, is also quiet.  

Cons: The entrance door to the hotel room has absolutely no sound deadening qualities whatsoever.  I could hear everyone's conversation in the hall as if they were talking to me.  Then, the next morning, there was repair work being done and I could hear drills and hammering from 9AM until when I left (12PM).  

BUT WHAT'S MOST ANNOYING IS: From 9AM until 11:45AM, I was visited by housing keeping three times.  All times I said come back after I check-out - completely ignored.  Check-out time is at noon, not 9AM, not 10AM, not 11:45AM.  I understand some people leave earlier than noon.  When that happens, it's certainly fine for the staff to then clean the room earlier than noon - the customer isn't there.  But not in my case.  I do not understand why the front desk staff cannot communicate with housekeeping to ensure that I am not constantly bothered by someone banging on my door all morning!  All it feels like is I'm trying to be shoved out of the hotel and that's uncalled for, ridiculous, and petty.",0.024282296650717704
Hilton New Orleans/St. Charles Avenue,New Orleans,1.0,"This hotel was depressing and the staff, in addition to being incompetent, were really rude. 

I called the day-of asking if early check-in was possible since we were arriving in the morning. I was assured that it would be. When I arrived we were checked in only to find the room was dirty and unmade. We asked for another room and were given a really bad room on the top floor with no windows. The power plugs did not work and the sheets were dirty! We came back to ask for yet another room. We were told we could wait in the executive lounge and in ""30 minutes at most"" another room would be available and they would call me.

I received no call so after 40 minutes I went back to the front desk where suddenly the tone had changed. I was told that I pressured the staff member into giving an ETA and that she never had wanted to in the first place and check-in is at 3pm and I should wait until then. By then I was done with being treated rudely and lied to so I found a great rate at the nearby Ace which was leaps and bounds better in terms of ambience, service, and quality.

I should also mention that we were also supposed to have gift bags from a wedding we were attending ready for us in the room. Not only did we never get ours, but neither did any other wedding guests. No apology was given or explanation, just ""if we find them, we'll call you"". Don't hold your breath. Also, every time I was at the front desk other guests were complaining about what should be basic things like keycards not working. This hotel is really an embarrassment to the Hilton name and it was painfully obvious at every juncture that the staff did not care one iota about our experience. I'll never stay at a Hilton again.",-0.015384615384615379
Hyatt Place Indianapolis Airport,Indianapolis,2.0,"I found this hotel quite disappointing.  I've stayed in Hyatt Place hotels before, and chose this because of the amenities somewhat unique to this class hotel - such as the 24 hour food availability and the bar/lounge area.  Unfortunately there was nothing impressive about this stay.  The mediocre condition room had a closet door off the tracks and a couple of the lamps seemed to have defective switches that required multiple attempts to get to come on. Although similar to other Hyatt Place rooms, there are certain aspects to the layout that are a bit awkward.  The service was basic at best, not rude but not friendly either. The overall condition of the hotel is just ok.  Can't say anything was terrible, but would look for another option next time.",-0.014379699248120296
Hilton Tampa Downtown,Tampa,1.0,"This is honestly one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a hotel. When we checked in at 3, our two rooms were not ready. The staff was exceptionally condescending about it as well and kept telling us how busy there were when there was literally no one else in line to check in so it did not seem that busy. We continued to wait for our rooms because we had requested specific rooms. After almost an hour of waiting after check in time, we went to the front desk again and asked about our rooms and they still were not ready. Ended up taking two random rooms just because they were actually ready. Then got to the rooms and it was underwhelming. The hallways clearly need to be redone and the doors look like they belong in a prison. The sheets are scratchy, the bathroom is small, and there is barely room to even open up luggage let alone keep it open for the rest of the trip. To make matters worse, they had some sort of live music at the pool which went on until 7 pm at night and it felt like the bass from the music was shaking my skull it was so loud. I'm sure all of the seven year olds and their parents loved the too loud music though at the pool. It really felt like their scene. Absolutely ridiculous. Really expected more out of this hotel. To make matters worse, tried to order food and there was not a single vegetarian/vegan option for entrées in the all day or dinner menu.

And then our last night another big one came crawling from the back of the TV. At this point we had to shake clothes before leaving and upon arriving back home. We were able to get the room cleaned i0each day, so that was a plus. The beds were decent despite the fact of feeling like we were in nastiness because of the roaches.

JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"This was the worst disastrous experience I have ever had at a Marriott ever. If I could give a negative five star rating I would. I went here with my son and brought his friend's to celebrate his 15th birthday party. We were harassed by staff and threatened because we had a couple extra kids and a two year old and were over the limit of people allowed by the pool. The pool area are was barely occupied empty seats every where and completely empty at 6:00 in the evening. I had no clue they strictly enforced such rules at a five star resort where u pay extremely high prices for service $1,000.00 for four hour stay to be harassed and refused service and threatened is a high price indeed. When I checked in staff was yelling at a guest, this should been my first clue. Then after escalating to a manager who did nothing to improve our experience I packed up disappointed kids and a toddler and left, because I refused to be treated in such a manner. If u have to talk to guest and have a security guard accompany you something is wrong with the way you do business. My suggestion is go to the Ritz Dove Mountain where they treat everyone with dignity and respect and appreciate your business!! Do not stay here. p.s. I have never seen security guard at any resort probably because everyone knows how to treat people and they aren't needed.

The big issue here is the pool/lazy river. First, the lazy river is filthy. They don't clean it but once in the morning and it shows. The water is cloudy and filled with bugs, hair, and random gross stuff. There are security guards but they're pretty worthless. Kids were jumping from the bridge into the shallow lazy river and not once did their parents or the security guards correct them/tell them that's a safety issue. Also, people love to stand in the lazy river, meaning they're not in an intertube or moving with the flow of the river, they just stand in the pool and it creates quite the traffic jam. Lastly, anyone can get in here since they don't require wristbands or anything. I'd say 75% of people at the pool just snuck in, they don't pay for a room or anything which I gathered based off the conversations they were having telling everyone that no one at the pool actually stays at the hotel.

It was wiped up but the smell was stiil in full force. We had a great time in New Orleans that night. The next day when we were getting ready to go, we found the shower didnt work.

This was the second year we hosted our event at this venue, despite the prior year's disappointing treatment from Hilton. This year was so disappointing to the extent that the treatment from Hilton staff was blatantly disrespectful. See list below:

1.) the wait staff (mainly bartenders) were extremely rude to our guests, they also over charged guests for drinks ($4.00 per 4oz of soda);
2.) the guests complained that many of main entrée options were not good, to point of being inedible (mainly the roast beef was disgusting, how can you serve bad food in New Orleans?);
3.) personal items of our firm's staff were STOLEN by Hilton employees prior to event (when we advised the hotel, no apology was given, the event manager that wasn't present during our event responded to this news by citing ""policy,"" stating that  they were not responsible) 
4.) additional bottles of alcohol ordered for the guests were taken by Hilton bartenders (we were billed for these items and never received the product or a refund);
5.) guests had to wait up to TWO HOURS for  valet to retrieve their car after the event;
6.) Hilton charged our account additional fees after the balance was paid in full without authorization or discussing the same with us. 

We weren't even afforded an event manager/coordinator the day of the event and quite frankly, I believe the sales personnel who did ""assist""  were purposely trying to inhibit our firm and guest from enjoyable event.

However I will say one of the housekeeping ladies was very helpful and kind.,0.019444444444444445
Indianapolis Marriott East,Indianapolis,1.0,"Stayed here last week for the first time and I will not be back.  I was told I was staying in a recently renovated wing of the hotel and had rather high expectations.  The room was large and nearly empty.  I had a sink and Fridge in there and both were rather gross.  I got past that as I was only there two nights and wanted to make the best of it.  I began working from my laptop and playing a bit of jazz music from it.  A few minutes later there is a pounding on my door.  I answer it and it is a hotel employee.  He said there was a complaint and if I do not stop playing my sax that I would be kicked out immediately.  I told him I was listening to Jazz on my laptop(mind you it is 6:15PM on a Tuesday) and he insisted I was having a party only to be surprised I was in the room alone.  I am a Bonvoy Gold member and stay at Marriott hotels very often and have never been spoken to so rudely.  His demeanor was hostile and unprofessional.

After my departure two days later, I did a survey sent to me after checking out.  I stated my issues and was reached out by the GM to be told that this situation was handled properly.  I responded to his email with a few thoughts and suggestions and have still not received any response.  Long story shot, I will not be returning to this hotel again.  There are far too many options in Indy to put up with service like this for nearly $175.00 a night.  Stay away from this hotel if you can help it.",0.04897142857142858
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"Extremely disappointing service.

Day 1: I trued to call guest services to see if the hotel had on hand an item I forgot to pack. Per the instructions on the room phone, I pressed the button marked ""guest services"". It rang forever with no answer. After 10 minutes of hanging up/trying again, I dialed the button marked ""room service"". Again no answer, and I was eventually routed to an automated system that went nowhere. I tried off and on for about 30 min as I got ready for the evening but never could get a live person, so eventually I gave up. That phone system never worked during my stay.

Day 2: I wanted to order something to eat and dialed for room service around 11:25 A.M. Again, no answer at ""room service"". By trying a few other buttons, I was able to eventually reach someone at the front desk (for which no number, button, or method of dialing was listed). I asked if she could direct me where to call to order food. She did not answer my question, but simply said, ""Breakfast is over. Lunch isn't until 12. You can order then."" She was very curt. I was taken aback at her tone and that she ignored my question, so I said ok and hung up. I looked at the room service menu again and saw that it lists lunch at 11:30. I called the front desk right back, explained lunch is listed at 11:30, and asked for clarification. She said, ""Oh. I didn't know the menu says something different,"" and transferred me without warning. She sent me to the room service line, where once again there was no answer and I was routed to an endless automated system. I called the front desk again and a different woman answered. I explained the above to her and she did not address, clarify, or apologize for the fact that the menu says 11:30. She ignored that part of what I said, but informed me that at 12 I could call the front desk again and ask to be transferred to the bar, where I should order. 

Day 3: The iron in our room had some black stuff melted onto it, which we did not notice until my friend's shirt got dirty from it. He called the front desk and requested a new iron, explaining why. They brought a new one shortly, but in a couple of minutes we discovered the second iron would not heat up. We tried a different outlet, but no luck. He called the front desk to request a third iron. They suggested perhaps the outlet was faulty, but he explained that we had already tried that. They agreed to bring another. When the third iron arrived, the person who brought it asked again if we were sure the outlet was wasn't to blame. We assured her that yes, we have basic problem-solving skills and had checked.

We enjoyed Bourbon Street a little too much and woke up late all the mornings we were here, missing housekeeping when they first knocked in the A.M. Each day when we left we either called/stopped at the front desk to explain that we'd missed them and request that they clean at some point. We were always told they'd come but they never did on our entire 4-day stay, even though housekeeping was still in other rooms on our floor every time we left. I'm sure housekeeping never received the message.

Problems: I work in customer service with highly demanding and high maintenance clients, so I can understand this industry and I empathize. But these people are in HOSPITALITY. They are supposed to do their best to make the stay pleasant/convenient for the GUESTS, not for THEMSELVES.  Every time we needed basic assistance it felt like an argument. We did not have extravagant requests. Why argue with me about when lunch is? It would have been amazing if anyone had said, ""I'm sorry about the mix up. What would you like to order? Lunch isn't delivered until after 12, but I would be happy to get a message to the bar for you and have it sent up at that time,"" instead of telling me to call back yet again. THAT is service. If they could have simply written my order on a Post-It and walked it to the bar 30 feet away from the front desk, I would have been so appreciative of their willingness to go above and beyond. I also am not sure why they would question more than once whether we tried a different outlet. Just say, ""I'm sorry about that. We'll get you a new one,"" and send up the iron! Especially the person who brought it. You are already here. You already had to come to my room. Just give me the iron and don't continue to insinuate that we inconvenienced you. 

We moved rooms on Day 3 because my friend found a cockroach in his bed and I was too creeped out to stay in there. We went down to the front desk and asked to be moved, which they did for us immediately. They were apologetic and efficient in this case. 

To be clear, I am not docking any stars for the roach. It's Bourbon. It's gross and dirty and there are bodily fluids all over the street outside. I would be shocked if zero roaches managed to get in the hotel, and it is not the fault of any of the customer-facing employees. They lost stars only due to their combative/unhelpful staff.",0.04988364454782366

Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"Worst hotel ever. Front desk was extremely rude. I booked through Hotels.com and paid for a deluxe room. Upon arrival they gave me a standard room and told me that I need to take it up with Hotels.com and I shouldn't book through a 3rd party. I called Hotels.com and they stated they had me reserved under a deluxe room and not a standard. Hotels.com calls Hilton and Hilton tells them there are no rooms left. So I take my $100 credit from Hotels.com and decide to stay overnight. 

During my stay, I break out in hives from the sofa chair and my husband has bug bites on his leg. 

We suck up the two days and leave. When I check out the front desk tells me that I have no incidentals and they will email me the bill. I never receive the bill. Three days later I see a charge on my credit card for $359. It took me 7 tries to get through to someone at the front desk. When I finally got through, an attendant by the name of Jessica was extremely rude. She stated that I was charged for $50 a night and incidentals and that I need to call Hotels.com to get it reversed. I asked her what the incidentals were for and she hung up on me. I had to call back 3 times before she picked up again. She acted like nothing happened when I stated that I must have been disconnected. She then stated that I was charged for two nights' stay. (What happened to the $50 a night or incidentals?) She then stated I need to call Hotels.com.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Tampa Airport - Westshore,Tampa,4.0,"It had been years since I'd last visited a Doubletree, but upon learning this was the official hotel for Yelp's Fall Break, I immediately remembered the amazing cookies... and that alone made me excited for my stay here. Yes, I equated a hotel with cookies... but pretty sure they're okay with that. Those things are legen - wait for it, and I hope you're not lactose intolerant because the second half of the word is - DA(I)RY.

I was put into a king bed room with a pool view on the 5th floor - a Hilton Honors floor (I have zero points with them, but I sign up for every rewards program there is in case they have any benefits, haha). This meant I got a better breakfast coupon as an Honors member than the Yelp deal coupons they gave us. Score! ...except I never woke up early enough to use them. Oh well :) Upon walking into my room, which was nicely appointed and looked recently upgraded, I found myself stepping on some pellets that looked like dry dog food. I ended up finding four or five pieces, so I went down to the lobby and asked the front desk if they could please vacuum the room. The woman who helped me was quite apologetic, although it really wasn't a huge deal to me... I just didn't want to step on any more of them. She gave me a free drink coupon for the Players Club restaurant, which was quite nice of her, but unnecessary. Since the hotel doesn't allow pets, she said this was a big deal. Okay, no worries... except when I returned to the room many hours later, I once again stepped on a piece of dog food, which told me the room was never vacuumed even after my request.

When I first booked the hotel, I made a request for foam pillows rather than down/feather pillows due to my allergies. I followed that request up with a phone call a week before my stay, asking for them to please note that I could not have anything with feathers in my room. I reiterated this upon check-in. Yet, when I walked into my room, there were five fluffy, feather-filled (how's that for alliteration?) pillows on the bed. I called the front desk, and was put through to the ""care line."" When I told the person on the phone this, she said, ""Well that's the first I've heard of this."" Um... okay... I don't know why, because I stated it several times. What use is it to have foam pillows as an ahead-of-time request option for your room if that request goes ignored anyway? To her credit, the lady on the phone did have someone bring up two foam pillows within just a few minutes. However, the feather pillows were not taken away, so I just put them on the opposite end of the room.

I considered giving this hotel three stars instead of four, but considering they gave me my room a good three to four hours earlier than the official check-in time, I'll keep it at four. Besides, the rest of my stay here was lovely. The bed itself was quite comfortable... so comfy, in fact, that any plans I had that Sunday to go relax by the pool were nixed when I realized I had no desire to get out of bed until it was absolutely necessary. Thankfully, check out was at noon, so I got to sleep in and enjoyed every minute of it. And really, the comfort of the bed is the most important factor to me! The staff members I encountered were all very friendly, and obliged my repeated requests for cookies whenever I went to the front desk. These cookies are divine, so very bad for you, and even more incredible when they're warm - they keep a warming oven at the front desk for this very reason. Eat them when they come right out of there - believe me, they are worth every last calorie.",0.23501837154614935
JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,3.0,"Had high hopes for this place! Driving up, it was so beautiful! Great views and neat looking hotel. We parked in the parking garage which was a bit of a pain dragging all of our things to the front desk to check in (we should have done this differently). We found our way to the front desk to stand in the long line until our group got called up to try to get rooms together. The guy must have been overwhelmed because he didn't listen at all. He put our friend in the same room with my husband and I. We told him a couple times that he was in a separate room. He then told us that they didn't have any more rooms available. It was just after 4pm (which is check in time). Eventually they text him about an hour later telling him it was ready but on a different floor.

We all changed and headed down to the pool. They make you stop and check in/get bracelets before allowing you to go in the pool area. They even check your bags - I mean go through every little thing in your bag...our friend brought a small cooler with a few beers in it, not knowing it was going to be a problem. They told him to take it back up to the room which was a long walk from the pool! He asked if he could just bring it since it's usually not a problem at the other hotels we go to. They were so rude and treated us like we were kids trying to smuggle stuff in. After all that, we went over to the lazy river (which was really neat!) We tried to get a servers attention to order drinks from but they didn't care too much to take our order saying they were busy. Finally placed an order. The drinks were so overpriced but I guess you can expect that at a place like this. Awhile later, we tried to find another person to take our order. Good grief...they need to reevaluate who works for them. These people should not be in customer service of any kind! They were rude and did not make you feel valued what so ever. Drink orders would take forever and on top of that, ""last call"" was at 5:30pm! They either need more servers so they aren't so ""busy"" or just make people get out and walk to the bar since they can't seem to make time for everyone.

On a positive note, the room was great. Very clean and nice! This hotel was very pretty and could be a great place if they stepped up the customer service. Such a bummer that this was our first impression - customer service is huge and can make or break your stay especially when you're paying good money for a fun getaway.",0.19914964866051824
Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"Unfortunately this hotel has gone down hill from what it used to be years ago. The front desk staff have a tendency to be rude and not care about your accommodations even when calling ahead of time and let's say asking for adjoining rooms or a crib. But the conditions of the hotel itself are daunting and to believe that Hilton as a brand is not on top of this, is quite unnerving. The cleanliness of the hotel is kept pretty poorly with peeling wall paper, mold in bathrooms, drops of strange substances around toilet and suite bar areas, clusters of dirt and debris culminated in corners of rooms, mysterious substances on the bedskirts of the beds, and stained dk brown carpet where you can't even be sure what you're walking on top of. This is not the worst of it folks, oh no there is more. I just came back from a weekend stay there and the I am disgusted and will never stay there with my family again. We got in late Friday and the minute we checked in and got off the elevator on our floor which was the 6th floor the smell of marijuana hit you like a ton of bricks. Because we were exhausted we just hoped our rooms wouldn't smell and we'd go to bed. We got into our rooms (mind you I was with a two and a 4 year old) and one of our rooms wreaked of smoke....this is supposed to be a non-smoking hotel. The air conditioner did not work in one room so we hoped by leaving the door in between our rooms open, we would get some cold air from the other room during our nights sleep. In the morning we woke up, ordered room service which was excellent actually. Also the valet service was excellent. Only two good things about it and one of the main housekeepers was incredibly nice and so was one of the bellhops we had to interact with the next night because....so we disappeared all day to visit family we have there and didn't come back to the hotel until 10:30. At that time, we walked in and our bedroom window was open. We thought perhaps the maid had left the window open because yet again there was an overwhelming smell of marijuana on our floor. Already sadly this was an indicator we wouldn't come here again along with the lack of cleanliness in the room. But then we noticed all the bugs that had flown in to the room. There were a lot. We decided we couldn't sleep there. We informed management. The housekeeper and a manager came up and at the time the manager looked at us and said ""oh well the bugs are here because they were attracted to the light. If you turn it off, they will go away."" Excuse me?!? No we weren't going to sleep with bugs for $200/night. We told him that there was no way this was acceptable and we didn't even leave the light or the window open! We didn't even know the windows could open. Finally we were moved to a suite which was all they had available. We needed double beds but there weren't any. My husband had to sleep on the sofa bed which everyone knows will be the worst sleep one can get and I slept with the two children in the king. I'll tell you the suite was in no better condition. Dirty, even an open safety pin was on the floor in the corner. A hair in the shower and it was not someone's head hair . Stains on carpet and bathroom floor. The toilet room light didn't work so you had to do your business with that door open to see. It was pretty bad. I kept telling my kids to wear socks if they were going to walk around and to not touch the carpet with their little hands. This hotel needs help. Corporate needs to know they need to change it up, upgrade the conditions it's currently in and find a way to better detect smoke. Oh by the way, the suite was on the 6th floor and that too smelled of marijuana and cigarette smoke combined! It was pretty overhwelming even in the mornings. Oh and I forgot to mention that my mother in law who stayed in the room adjoining us on the 6th floor reported that there were already new guests in the bug room and she didn't hear anyone in the middle of the night change sheets or clean the room. Which potentially means the new guests would be in the room we had vacated as it was with the bed sheets we used. Frankly we don't even know if we slept in clean sheets either! Having said all of this we will never stay here again unless Hilton really makes an effort to renovate and change things around here.  I felt it was my duty as a mother and a concerned guest to warni anyone else about the poor conditions of this hotel as well.",0.026802641802641806
Home2 Suites by Hilton Tampa USF Near Busch Gardens,Tampa,2.0,"After a 12 hour day at Bush Gardens with family I couldn't wait to get to the hotel to shower and sleep. We booked two rooms that had to be connecting. One was for the adults and the other was for the teenage girls. When we get to the hotel we find out the rooms were across from each other. This is not what I asked for upon making the reservation in advance. The front desk had two males, one said ""Well, before a bomb goes off I will look for a room that connects.""I assume he meant I was the bomb. That was rude. I told them I made the reservation directly with the hotel and just had that one request. The other male stated to me in a snarky way that I can request what I want but they will only give it to me if it is available. If that's the case I wouldn't have booked a room there. So beware of requests, they may not be honored. They didn't seem apologetic but more like they were being bothered. When we enter the rooms I was pleased. They were clean, looked new, and looked like they'd be a great space for a long stay. My stay was only overnight. I didn't want to drive back home to Orlando. Throughout the night I was hot and then cold. I believe it was the AC malfunctioning. At 8:30am I heard a huge bang and then a loud noise that wouldn't stop. It was the AC. I called the front desk. The lady informed me the building lost power. I asked her if she could hear the noise from the AC. I told her about my hot and cold night. She seemed frustrated and hung up on me! What terrible customer service this hotel has. I was furious! The noise didn't stop until some time after 10:30am when the power came back on.  When I finally went downstairs I heard the same voice of the woman who hung up on me complaining about the guests. Another woman was on the phone, pacing, sounding upset, telling someone she had no internet service and couldn't check people out. In these types of situations, they should be apologetic not angry. The guests are angry because they have paid for their stay that has been interrupted. The service team is angry at what? That they have to apologize and work with what they have? It's not how bad your situation is but how your attitude is and how you overcome it! If you are angry the guests will be more angry. I gave only two stars because I knocked off two stars for the rude staff at night and in the morning. The other star I knocked off was for not having the connecting rooms as requested or at least saying when making a reservation your requests may not be honored and are subject to availability such as my case.",-0.07350332594235032

Hilton Tampa Downtown,Tampa,2.0,"Dated Hotel Sub-Standard Front Desk Experience

I was attending an enormous conference, spending several thousand dollars, and booked three rooms for my staff on October 25. Upon check-in, I identified myself as a shareholder and Hilton Gold Member and asked about breakfast vouchers.

The front desk manager somewhat rudely told me, ""this Hilton does not offer that perk/privilege."" However, continental breakfast is served in the upstairs lounge reserved for Honors Members. I tried the lounge, which was not the sit-down breakfast full-service experience I was seeking. I politely informed the front desk manager I was spending several thousand dollars, booked three rooms, and just wanted a full-service breakfast.

Hilton has a 100% Guarantee of Satisfaction and even though I was not even close to 50%, I was not asking for a free night or to be compensated in any manner. I was looking for a little comfort and believed that a good breakfast would be a good start. The front desk manager stated she would speak with management and get back to me, which never happened.

I called Hilton corporate, and while I was on the line, the customer service representative told me the front desk manager told them they did not serve breakfast downstairs in the restaurant, which was a lie since I had been there that morning.

The second Hilton corporate customer service representative told me, unfortunately, this is an independently owned Hilton, and that was their policy.

Moreover, she would bring up my issue to management at the hotel; however, it would most likely not be resolved until after my stay. Now, I was incredibly disappointed that Hilton would treat anyone this way and will never stay or recommend that anyone stay at this location. They need to take customer service more seriously, especially since there are numerous hotel options at more modern hotels at a lower price.

In summary, all I was asking for was a complimentary breakfast downstairs, and if handled in a more caring professional manner, could have avoided this review and my poor customer experience.",0.08701923076923078

-The shower head was actually phenomenal. Likely the best hotel shower I've ever had
-Location was less than desirable for French Quarter access. Not way out of the way but not close either
-At one point a staff member walked in the room while I was changing. They caught a glimpse and walked out. I (put on some underwear then) followed them out to see what was going on...I was a tad startled. They then started a discussion with me about two bottles of water from the minibar that the previous occupant had drank and asked me to restock them for her. I agreed, while still in my underwear. At checkout, they tried to charge me for those two bottles of water. Needless to say, I filled them in on my story and refused to pay. The exceptionally rude front desk employee (she had been rude from first arrival to checkout) rolled her eyes and said, ""fine, I won't charge you.""

Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,5.0,"5 STARS TO THE STAFF who were on their toes 24-7, and 1 or NO STARS TO THE HOTEL GUESTS who were LOUD, inconsiderate and ridiculous. What a terrible way to behave in front of the world who ventures to Philadelphia to understand our colonial history. 

We stayed over this past weekend and entered the hotel to this HUGE din of noise from very loud guests, many screaming in their cell phones in front of everyone. We could not hear each other speak. It was deafening. Somehow the culture of our country has become one of total self-involvement, never mind the people around you. 

When we checked out and were waiting for our party, a party of 10 came in to talk to another party--again boisterous and rude behavior and speaking. They were SO loud. If the hotel might have tried to fix these groups they would have been dinged on review sites. Folks, please remember your manners at hotels. You are not the only person on the planet but people all over the world only see YOUR type on reality shows and other stuff. 

Now, every time we needed something from the confusion about the cost of wifi connection and requests to re-enter our room after check-out, we were met with consideration. When standing looking puzzled we always had someone approach us to help. We met our maid by accident and she was delightful. I did wonder, however, with the calibre of people in the hotel the weekend we were there, would they even tip this hardworking soul at all?",0.006444444444444452
Best Western Plus City Centre Inn,Edmonton,1.0,"To say the yelling and screaming children down the halls past 10 is the least of my concerns isn't good. 

Will say my housekeeper is great and the room is clean. 

As for the front desk clerk... I witnessed some awful racism last night. I met a friend in the lobby to give her something and we chatted an caught up. A while later a gentleman came to the lobby with bags and his friend came from a room about 5 minutes later to greet him. They also decided after exchanging their item to catch up as they too were good friends. 

After a bit, a clerk asked the guy not in a room to leave. At first, myself and my guest figured maybe it was quiet hours and I'd need to go to my room. The gentleman with his friend kept saying ""we're just talking. He's a guest, I'm visiting him."" The front desk clerk then said he'd call the police. Why were the police being called on these two men who were quieter than us was a mystery. The only difference was the colour of their skin. The police showed up and said the guy was being asked to leave. I asked one of the officers if he had to leave if my friend had to as well. The police came and spoke with us and we explained everything we saw. The police said the clerk had called and said these men were aggressive and belligerent. They really weren't (I've worked in security, these men were the opposite of belligerent). Finally the one police officer said what we were all thinking. What was the difference in the two groups? Because this looked racist. 

The clerk said folks in the lobby had to identify themselves. The police asked if we'd been asked to identify ourselves (we didn't).

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",New Orleans,1.0,"I'm really laughing at some of these four and five star reviews. Look, I am going to give you guys the real tea. This place is absolutely trash. Its not because it's a bad looking hotel- it's because of some of the people that are employed here and their horrible service. It's a shame because the hotel is actually really cute with swanky decor-also it is in a prime location. Only a few blocks from the French Quarter and not too far by car from the convention center. However that's all this hotel has going on for them. 

Strike one was valet. We pulled up expecting for valet to help us with our luggage. We actually waited in our car a few minutes to see if he would approach us-but to no avail. He didn't even try to help us until I went in the hotel to get the cart and began loading our luggage myself. 

Strike two was the incredibly rude display of ignorance that the concierge extended to us. Upon walking out of the lobby minding our own business- he yelled out verbatim ""Y'all been here all day and y'all can't smile!"". I was totally floored. First of all I shouldn't have to pay to stay somewhere to be harassed. I get that for free out in public. Second, whatever happened to professionalism and being a gentleman. I proceed to tell him off for his audacity to tell women he doesn't know to ""smile"" for him. This ignorant amoeba follows us outside trying to make us feel bad because I put him in his place. It was an incredulous experience to say the least. I can't believe a hotel concierge would be as ghetto and ignorant as what was displayed that day. He was arguing with me because I wouldn't allow him to disrespect us. What a tool. When the idiot finally stopped harassing us we again waited for valet to acknowledge us. This time it was about six men 
Standing around the podium doing nothing and wasting space. We spotted our truck and proceed to our vehicle. Our truck was the only vehicle there-one of guys finally comes to give us our keys. Why didn't you give us our keys when we came outside when the concierge was harassing us? Incompetent. So incompetent. 

Strike three was front desk telling us when we were trying to check out to come down and get a cart ourselves because they are ""busy"". You can't make this stuff up. That's the attitude that most of the employees had the entire weekend we stayed. It's like they didn't want to help us and when they did help it was done with a begrudging spirit. I literally ran into only three employees that were kind and professional. That's shameful since we stayed for four days. 

This place doesn't have a pool. Instead they have a top floor lounge that I heard is pretty nice but I wouldn't know because I refused to give this hotel anymore money other than the rate for our room. They also have a restaurant but again I didn't patronize because of reasons aforementioned. They have a pretty descent fitness room. Rooms are small. Even the lobby area is cramped.

Hilton New Orleans/St. Charles Avenue,New Orleans,2.0,"Where do I start? I arrive at the hotel, and was greeted, by, ""Hey."" Nothing more. That was a clue for what was to come. He checked me in, and handed me a key, ""Here's your key."" No, ""the elevators are over there or...do you have any questions...can I help you with anything else...?"" Just, ""Here's your key."" The room was fine. No complaints - nothing fancy, but perfectly adequate. I was here for work, so I went to the restaurant for dinner - alone - and since there was no space at the bar and a wait for tables, I was told I could order from the bar ""to go"" and eat in my room. I stood for several minutes at the bar while the bartender talked to his friend, and was completely ignored - I never even got a menu handed to me. So, I gave up and went back to my room to order room service. I ordered, and eventually got my meal - but not my drink. I called room service three times to ask for my drink - but no-one picked up! So, I called the front desk - who got me in touch with the bar - and they said they'd bring me my drink. Finally, the guy brings me my drink to my room about 20 minutes later after my food got cold. He did say, ""sorry about that"" - but no offer to give it to me free of charge, or give me another, or a coupon for a free drink. Nothing. Food was pretty good, btw, albeit over-priced. 

So, the next morning, I think, ""it's a new day."" But, when I go to the bar for breakfast - I tell them, ""I only have 15 minutes and have to be in my room for a conference call - so  what can I get quickly? I order what they say would be the fastest thing on the menu - ""yogurt with granola and fruit."" It takes a full 12 minutes - to finally bring it to me - so I am going to have to run up to my room to make the call. For $12 it was about a cup of yogurt, with barely a tablespoon of yogurt, 10 (I counted) blueberries, and 1 strawberry. Ok fine. Not the end of the world....but for $12 I did expect a bit more! With 2 minutes to spare,  I got to the lobby, where the front desk person ignored me and didn't even say ""good morning"" - I went to the ""free coffee station"" and...NO COFFEE! 

I get to my room for what will now be a coffee-free conference call. So, I get on my call - and put the ""Do Not Disturb"" sign on the door. 10 minutes into the call, I get a knock on the door. It is someone at the door wanting to take my dishes away - Did he not see, ""Do Not Disturb?!"" What did he think that sign was there for?!

It was as if it were the first day of opening with all new hires just out of junior high. We were not greeted entering the check in area and when we walked up to the counter, our two separate parties experienced the same girl who was bothered we were making her work. When we asked about Bell Hops she flippantly responded with ""oh, they all got fired"" I corrected her with ""maybe you shouldn't say that or try furloughed due to pandemic"". She did not appreciate the suggestion or the shocked look her co-worker gave her. She also took our credit card for incidentals and actually ran it for a strange amount then had to fix that error. It took her forever to get us checked in. Normally, this would not be a big deal, but she was just so rude about her ways.  I assumed this was just a bad apple. Nope, the next day we asked at check in if there was a concierge and this girl too was bothered by us. We asked if there was a map of the hiking trails or if she knew anything about them and she said there was not and didn't know. Our only positive each day was Chris/Christopher (I hope that's correct) at Valet who on day 2 was the only person who greeted us and that knew there was a map for trails and actually went and got us one (he overheard us grumbling in shock at the rude girl at check in desk who was dismissive & clueless and asked if he could help) day 3 Chris/Christopher greeted us again & offered places to dine.  On the day of our check out my friend and I reminded the front desk we were splitting the bill and we gave the counter person both of our credit cards.  We had two separate invoices and we each signed one. The following month I see on the credit card statement she charged the same amount to only one card. In order for me to fix that the hotel let me know I had to do the work, I had to get my friend to email her information to them and once they charged her card they'd reimburse me.  She was supposed to have received some email with the information, she did not.  I called the hotel again, same information and while I let them know this was not my fault and I'm super aggravated at their mistake and lack of doing much to fix it I NEVER received an apology or real help.

Arrival was fine aside from being put into a room with a King bed for 2 adults and a 16 yr old girl. Had ordered the 2 queen room and eventually got it. 

The big trouble started when we returned after the swim meet looking for dinner. Went to Cactus Rose and was told it would be 10 min because the kitchen was overwhelmed by a private party. Plenty of tables available and they could have seated us and provided drinks. It was 110 degrees outside and we were thirsty. We were told to wait in the bar, which sounded fine until we found out that the bar tender had gone on break. And there was no one to serve us. We waited.....

About 10 minutes later a young hostess comes out asking for another couple, there was no one ahead of us on the list. I told her we were waiting and she said she didn't know about that. She then proceeded to chat with a customer at the bar and completely ignored us. We left and had a great meal at Cheddars.

So I made it simple and asked for strawberry daiquiris. She blended one of them, which took a really long time. She had to go in the back and get things she didn't have on hand.

Our hotel suite was very clean, had a bedroom with French doors, and a TV in the bedroom. There were plenty of towels in the bathroom, two rolls of toilet paper, and the regular toiletries. The shower had a heat lamp, which I've never seen before. The mini fridge was stocked with water bottles, and the living room TV was a huge flat screen bolted down to the console to deter theft.

This is a large hotel.  We did not take advantage of any of the amenities: the restaurant, bar, gym, Starbucks, gift shop, etc.   Although, I did notice that they were in use by many of the hotel's guests
  
The rooms were also nicely decorated, comfortable beds-- if you need a safe, make sure you request a room with a safe.  (Ours did not have one.)

STAFF
-Overall, I found the all of the staff members except one person for be helpful, warm and professional.  Prior to arriving, I had called to request an early check-in, and arrangements were made without issue.  Checking in and checking out was also a breeze.    The staff member who did not meet expectations was the woman who was working in the valet. I observed and felt that the woman who worked at the valet was extremely short--borderline rude with all hotel guests.  

PARKING
$48 per night... The valet is 24 hours.  Initially, $48 for a 1 night stay seemed a little steep; however, it appears parking is $$ in Philly due to the limited space.  The convenience of having a valet, and not worrying about tickets, tows, etc made it all worth it.",0.19764194139194136

Four Points by Sheraton Suites Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,3.0,"I like... I don't like... 
I like... I don't like...
Obviously I have mixed opinions on this hotel....

* * * FIRST VISIT * * * 

Our initial visit included reserving (2) hotel rooms (for us and another couple).  Prior to finishing our reservation on the website I called the hotel to confirm two things (a) the two hotel rooms would be next-door to each other and (b) we wanted to request and know the possibility of early check-in (noon instead of their standard 3 pm).  The hotel operator said neither request should be a problem but suggested we call the hotel on the arrival day early in the morning to assure the rooms were adjacent to each other (which we did).

We arrived at the hotel and the exterior is very nice. The hotels interior is basically a huge atrium with lots of foliage and interesting pathways through the center.  There are plenty of conference rooms, a restaurant, entertainment/open area, a gym and an indoor pool.

We arrived at just after 3 pm, so the early check in request (that they could not guarantee even though it is offered on their website during booking) was not needed after all. The front desk staff were friendly.... but... Ironically, only one of our two rooms was ready so even though we arrived at a fair time we had no room.  We were told it would be ready any moment so we followed our friends to their room to wait.  

After about an hour I was getting antsy (as this is not ""any moment"") and peeking out the door looked as if no housekeeping has entered the neighboring hotel room.  I decided to call the front desk.  I lady's voice on the other end of the phone was unbelievably rude... it takes a lot to get me excited and this lady seemed to know all the right buttons to push.  Her name is LUCY and I hope no one has to deal with this lady on a regular basis.

I immediately went down stairs to get my room situated and place a complaint on Lucy with the hotel manager.  Go figure, no manager is ever available when you want to place a complaint or have a situation.  The front desk clerk assured me he would (a) get my room done immediately and (b) have a hotel manager contact me to discuss my complaint.

My room was ready right after that but can you believe it was already after 5 pm.... 

At least the room was quite large with a separate bedroom from the living/kitchenette area, it was clean, the bathroom was rather nice and the bed was comfortable.

The only other complaint was the hotel had a lot of kids running around on all floors screaming and playing in the elevators... it really wasn't that big a bother but surprised the hotel doesn't have security or front desk stall request the parents to control the kids (especially since we did see people complain to the front desk).

* * * SECOND VISIT * * * 

So why return when the staff was so disorganized that my room was not prepared timely and no manager ever contacted me regarding the unprofessional behavior of their phone operator (Lucy)... Simply because hotels of the same price range nearby (that I have stayed at) were not nearly as clean or comfortable; so we're back (just us in one room this time).

This time our hotel room was ready upon our arrival and our front desk clerk was beyond friendly; but I would be lying if I didn't mention that I cringed at one point when I saw Lucy (the rude operator from my previous visit) come out to the front desk area and I got to observe her berate another front desk staff member.  

Pleasantly surprised to see the hotel had done a bunch of improvements since our last visit (roughly 4 months earlier). 

Once again our room was very accommodating.

The only hiccup during our stay was their was loud commotion going on in the room above us starting around midnight; like someone was moving furniture or jumping on the couch... I really have no idea what it was but it was really disturbing.  After an hour I once again I had to contact the front desk and request someone check the room because it was very disruptive.  They said no but would move us to another room... WOW!   (no, we did not move rooms)

So, I try my hardest to fall asleep and the noise ended around 2 AM and I finally fall asleep.... UNTIL someone was knocking on the door at 3 AM... I was too tired to get up but they were insistent and the knocking continued... FINALLY I get up and open the door... ""HOUSEKEEPING, HERE IS EXTRA BLANKET YOU REQUESTED"".... I'm just flabbergasted that I could not get the hotel to knock on a door to get another room to quiet down at midnight but they can knock on my door over and over until I had to answer at 3 in the morning.

Even with the fair rates, comfortable beds, large rooms, overall cleanliness (4 stars), compared to their inconsistent customer service (2 stars)... I don't know if I would return.",0.07673789173789176
Four Points by Sheraton French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Great location next to bars and clubs on bourbon street and near the vampires if you're into that kind of stuff (wassup lestat)

Terrible hotel if you want to laugh or enjoy life with your friends. 

I stayed here over the weekend with 8 other people (we booked four separate rooms) for a 30th birthday celebration. The first night at our room (Saturday) was fine, we even got upgraded to a room with a balcony facing the parking lot- humble brag nbd- and one of our rooms even came with roaches- again NBD.  That night around 12am, as my gal pal and I were giggling doing real housewives impersonations when we had a spooky loud knock on our door- I love a haunt but sadly this hotel wasn't on ghost hunters. We assumed it was someone on our floor messing with us, but did I call the front desk? No, because snitches get stitches. Anywho, we fall asleep while doing our best Ramona's and Bethany's and kept to ourselves. Plot twist- we are led to *believe* it was our neighbors in the room next door knocking on our door. 

Ok then. 

The next night, Sunday, at 10pm,  my guests and I (again 9 people who booked separate rooms at the Sheraton) went back to the hotel room to have some homemade banana bread cake. We were in the room for a total of 30 minutes. During this time, security paced outside the door and told us several times we were getting noise complaints and are being too loud.  For those who haven't been to the French quarters, there is never a moment of peace - which is what makes Nola so fun - THE JAZZ AND NOICE FLOWS FROM THE STREETS- so my group and I decided to be respectful and to talk and hangout in the hotel lobby instead,since laughing in your room is discouraged, and let our hotel neighbors get a peaceful night of rest on silent bourbon street (lol ikr). Now that I think about it, we were so busy stuffing our faces with banana bread cake- we barely had time to SPEAK. 

On our way out, we stopped by the front desk to ask the night manager what their noise policy was, since this is a hotel on bourbon street with a club next door, you'd expect guests to understand it's going to be a bit loud here and there. They even offer earplugs with every room. Heh the irony. The night manager and front desk clerk, rudely told us they had ""preferred"" hotel members complaining about the noise coming from our room and because they were ""preferred"" , the hotel would side with them and kick out 9 people instead (btw we were with army personnel so I guess you can say they're UNPATRIOTIC and don't love America.) The night manager raised his voice at us saying we were out of line and was visibly losing his cool and our totally rational questions, It was one of those moments where someone goes from yelling to ""I'm not yelling"" when they're called out for losing their cool- UH YA you were yelling pal. Totally uncalled for! 

I wish I could say we were loud, drunk and rowdy, but really were a bunch of sober 30 year olds with belly's full of banana bread cake just looking to laugh with old friends and do Kermit the frog impressions. 

If you took the time to read this- book a ghost tour with Dylan hunter from phantom encounters, he's great! And Muriel's is delicious and haunted WE SAW A GHOST HERE!!! But please, don't stay at the four points Sheraton. The management is rude, the rooms have roaches, and the room service ""fresh fruit"" was rotten. Lastly, the  walls are paper thin, if you want to have fun with your friends or idk BREATHE book a room else where. Otherwise papa Sheraton will belittle you and threaten to kick you and your guests out. If there is a W near by stay there! The W also has better skincare products - just sayin. Hey W, call me up! 

my 8 guests and i are extremely disappointed and offended by how management handled this ""noise"" situation. It was rude and plain ol mean. Please stop attacking your guests when they ask what your standard policies are. If you have a no noise ever policy, maybe leave it on a little note pad next to the ear plugs you provide to block OUT NOISE BECAUSE NEW ORLEANS IS (not for nothin) LOUD.",0.12636530136530136
Hilton Indianapolis Hotel & Suites,Indianapolis,4.0,"My gosh. Beautiful suite. Order some nachos, and 3 beers. They say 20 minutes. 1 hour later they don't know where to deliver food????? I asked for the manager. According to him They're supposed to know which room to deliver to when we call  but somehow they do not.  

2 hours later food shows up but they can't leave beer with my 20 year old. Ok. So I call. They're doing a shift change and don't know when beer can be delivered. Wtf. I say well I really don't think I should be charged for any of this. They have no answer. 

So last night we go up to the hot tub at 10:50, yes we know they close at 11. We had just driven and wanted to hop in real quick because earlier when we came up there were 3 children under age 5 with floats in the hot tub. Ok. The maid apparently had done her cleaning early and was not happy. She says it's 10:50. I say yes I know we have 10 minutes right?? Rude. Marches off. I mean damn. 

Done. Not staying here again. Looking forward to leaving tomorrow. Sad.  Very, very disappointed.

UPDATE: A manager named Alex called us this morning and offered the 4 of us free breakfast buffet (a value of around $80). Was very kind and apologetic. Food was delicious. 

UPDATE 2: Driving home a manager named Jason called. He'd just read my review and was very apologetic and kind as well. Comped our $85 room service food from Saturday night after the Cake concert (that food was also delicious).  I have to say, I'd definitely give this place another go round. They absolutely made up for mistakes and said that changes would be made . Thank you Alex and Jason.

Marriott Indianapolis North,Indianapolis,2.0,"I wanted this hotel to be so much better than what it was. First off, our ceiling was peeling either from previous water damage or it was just old. We requested for maintenance to come and look at our room to see what was the issue to either get it fixed or switch rooms. For me it was a huge eye sore. They came the next day after we requested it for the 3rd time. They came and said they would fix it but it would take 2-3 hours to finish and since we had a small child they wouldnt recommend them fixing it because of the the sanding down and other things that needed to be done. Also they didn't have any other rooms for us to go in so we had to stay there since we needed to stay for 3 nights. Also we requested for our rooms trash to be emptied and more face cloths well before 12pm when they say you must ask for housekeeping. Please tell me why it took a whole 24 hours for them to come to our service call. I honestly felt extremely ignored and when I called down to the service desk the front desk agents attitude was so bad I could tell he was very stressed and irritated and he took it out on me by basically telling me to suck it up they only have 1 housekeeper and that I'd be put on the waiting list. Regardless of what time I requested the towels and trash to be emptied. Last but not least our room was a King bed facing the lake with a sofa bed let out. When we went to let the sofa bed out there were stains on the mattress that looked like old blood. Just sick! I pushed the bed right back in. Also requested a crib for our 1 year old NEVER GOT IT! The other star is for the pool. We had a nice time by the pool even if it was a little dirty and old. The pool floor is discolored and the water was foggy. I had goggles. Definitely need to be deep cleaned. This is not Marriotts standard . I don't know what happened with this hotel. Needs work. Room was clean upon arrival though the bed sheets were freshly cleaned I could smell them so that's a plus. The window was dirty with finger prints from previous guests so they need help with the cleaning. The drinks at the bar were good . Overall I give them a two out of 5.",0.029331204026325976
Hyatt Centric Center City Philadelphia,Philadelphia,4.0,I booked a night here for a weekend getaway from NYC (really just an excuse to eat at Reading Terminal Market).  The location was excellent since it was in Center City.  The hotel was fairly new and I liked the modern decor.  The hotel room itself was clean.  The front desk service was very friendly and helpful for check-in and luggage storage.  It was a really good deal for a new hotel.  The only complaint (why I wouldn't give 5 stars) was the 2nd floor restaurant since we had breakfast there.  The restaurant service was super slow and the staff seemed confused about where we could sit.  It took more than half hour for coffee refills and service in general.  The breakfast food was good but It was a bit frustrating dealing with the rude and slow service.  I would stay at this hotel again but I would skip the restaurant.,0.1288983585858586
JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,2.0,"I am going to write this review with the preface that we didn't end up staying at the hotel because the booking experience was so awful. I called to ask about rates before booking and was asked the same questions over and over again like what city and state the Starr Pass Resort was in... once the gentleman finally figured out what he was doing he put me on hold for a while which is fine but when he came back he told me they didn't have the government rate I was asking about, that he could book me in a hotel down the street for the government rate and that he wanted my email to book. 

I explained that I was calling about Starr Pass and that I wanted to stay there if possible. He tells me he will check availability and tells me it will be over 200 a night but there is only one room available and I need to give him my email to book right away...  I don't like the rush to book me when it doesn't even seem like he is listening to me or trying to help. Also my son made some noise in the background at one point during the call and he said, no kids are checking in right? in a very rude tone. I could understand if he needed to know but don't be a jerk about it. 

I was seriously unimpressed and ended up letting him know we were no longer interested in booking. Hopefully staying there is better than booking there.

JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"Came here for a wedding on 11/18/2018 and had the worst experience for service. Everything for the wedding was beautiful but the women serving our table at the reception really put a damper on the mood and made it awkward for my table and the parents table. Since I'm related to the bride, my table was all family as well as my parents table was all the older relatives. So this lady is serving the family tables. I'm not sure what her name was but she was an older server with white grey hair. Her name was maybe Donna or Debbie I'm not sure.

Everyone had a different experience with this lady. She was very rude and made weird comments about everything and sipping left over champagne from the bottles. She also scolded my uncle when he took a sip of champagne before the toast and then even refused to give my cousin a piece of wedding cake since he already had a brownie. The list goes on and on. 

One thing in particular she said to me that was absolutely MORTIFYING was when she came around with champagne. When she got to me I asked if I can have cider instead. This lady straight up asked me in front of the entire table ""What are you, PREGNANT??"" I was so shocked and mortified I didn't even know what to say. It made the mood so awkward and everyone couldn't enjoy their time at dinner because of her.

Honestly this lady got lucky I just wanted cider because I just don't like the taste of champagne. Can you imagine if I was pregnant and didn't want to tell my family?? Or if I just had a miscarriage or couldn't get pregnant?? This was a whole new level of rudeness that it's unheard of. Worst experience in service in my life and this was at the JW Marriott!!

That being said, when you're made to feel unwelcome by someone working at an establishment, that is an attitude issue that needs to be brought up to management.

We watched AMANDA serve a few customers, play with the channels on the TV, talk about the game that was currently on, talk to children, listlessly mull about, play with receipts, and generally go out of her way to avoid eye contact with us. We gave her the benefit of the doubt. We flagged her down, which resulted in her rudely telling us she ""needed a minute"" while still refusing to make any eye contact or effort to figure out what we wanted after a few minutes.

JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,2.0,"I was very excited about my visit to the JW Marriott Star Pass resort in October. The resort and grounds are beautiful, but I should have read the TripAdvisor and Yelp reviews more carefully. This property has the potential to be one of America's most beloved resorts, but it falls flat in a few areas.

First, bear in mind I was there five nights and spent over $1,500 for my stay, so I have some experience with the property.

The good:
* The location is fantastic, especially if you want to be away from downtown traffic.
* Best access to Saguaro National Park West and the Desert Museum - both a must-see.
* As others have noted, the rooms could stand a little refreshing, but I enjoyed the rustic charm.
* The grounds and surrounding area are great, with wonderful views of Tucson at night and the saguaro cactus-covered hills surrounding the resort.
* They offer some unusual daily programs (Native American morning ceremony, the daily hike, and the sunset tequila toast are notable.)
* Complimentary laundry room for guest use, a nice feature to have after you have been hiking in the desert all week.
* Valet service runs $25 per day, is extremely convenient, and I had nothing but good experiences with their staff. My car was always waiting and ready to go, plus they have coolers full of bottled water to take with you on your desert adventures. Nice touch.
* The resort fee is $29 per day. With that, you have access to the various pools, Lazy River, the golf driving range at Star pass Golf Club, the well-stocked 24-hour gym, etc. I did try the Lazy River which was very enjoyable, but some features like the water slide were turned off because the hotel was empty during the week.
* The separately-run Hashami Spa located on the property is very nice, if expensive, and has its own outdoor pool, hot tub and cabana setup. Plus, Marriott/Bonvoy rewards members may use the indoor hot tub and steam room- both kept in excellent condition in the respective single-sex changing rooms by simply showing their room key. Unfortunately, they changed the closing hours from 7 pm to 5 pm while I was there, again, due to a lack of people staying at the resort.

The bad:
Unfortunately, this list ranges from minor inconveniences to completely dreadful.
* The free parking arrangement is ridiculous because the parking garage (good) is located all the way at the far side of the property (bad). If you forgot something in the car, it will be a half-hour roundtrip to retrieve it. 
Unfortunately, people that do not want to pay the valet charge but still want easy access to their car are encouraged to park on the narrow, winding road leading to the resort. Not a problem inbound, but you need to be very careful leaving the resort so that a door does not fly open or a small child dart out from between vehicles, because the cars are actually halfway into the roadway itself.
* Depending on when and where you eat at the resort, the food is just OK. 

Lastly, there is the service staff. This was the source of my highest dissatisfaction with the property. About half the hotel employees I came in came in contact with during my stay were great. The others? Well, Marriott desperately needs to hold some customer service training at this facility.
Millennials are the perennial target of customer dissatisfaction, but they have raised it to an art form here. I should mention that all hotel personnel with some grey hair or that were clearly born in another country were terrific. It was just that magical, entitled, American-born age group that I had issues with. From check-in to bar waitstaff, most of the American Millennials I dealt with were either disinterested, uninformed or flat-out rude.

When you check-in, they make a big deal about handing you your room key with both hands, with head slightly lowered- a cheapened facsimile of a Japanese business card exchange. I don't know whose idea in corporate marketing that was, but instead of putting so much effort into cultural appropriation that feels forced and artificial, their efforts would be much better spent convincing the Millennials to follow up on commitments and sticking to truthfulness. In a time where #metoo and #believewomen are the hallmarks of our national consciousness, I was lied to four different times the night I checked in by... women.

Finally, there was the bar staff member (another Millennial) that was so incredibly rude it practically ruined my stay. I did not get her name (my mistake) but from reading other reviews she is clearly a problem and continues to be employed despite her unprofessional behavior and having been reported to management numerous times.

Needless to say, I will never stay at this property again. The grounds are beautiful, and I love the location. However, the staff soured me on the whole Marriott experience. As a frequent traveler for work, I will be looking at offerings from other hotel chains for my hard-earned vacation plans.",0.11168300653594765

These people were loud and disrespectful.  Security seemed to be cool with it.  They gave them a hug at one point!

William Hess is a poor manager and failed miserably and didn't rectify the situation.  He is rude and not helpful even with all the evidence I showed him.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Indianapolis North,Indianapolis,2.0,"As a share holder for this Company I am really disappointed with the staff other then the management team and the cleaning crew.  The way the staff treated me and other guests here is unacceptable.  Receptionist for all shift was rude, bartenders was rude to everyone, and the cleaning crew was the only nice people there.  Restaurant staff talked to me like ok what you doing here attitude give me your order and just rushed off like they had stuff to do in a non busy restaurant.  Rooms needs some attention, the first one my family and I got seemed to be a rushed cleaned job and they just put together and didn't clean.  After complaining with management they gave us a good clean room that was up to Hilton standard.  Our welcome packet only had water and nothing in it which we a share holder I usually expect more and we complained about that and they gave us a full welcome packet.  I work customer service and I would never treat my customers like this I treat them with the other most of kindness with all the rough time they are going through. Overall this is an alright stay, I rather go stay at Best Western and get treated better there then paying people to treat me and my family like garbage for a company I invest on.",0.17708333333333334
Philadelphia Marriott Downtown,Philadelphia,1.0,"I have been coming to the Philadelphia Marriott
Downtown Hotel for an annual convention for the past 10 years and have stayed with this hotel 3 times until two incidents led me to book somewhere else. Staff is rude and one staff who worked at the buffet line, was downright racist. This staff and a another Chinese staff was working on the buffet line, and upon seeing another Asian person on the line, loudly commented to his Asian co-worker, ""hey look, it is the Chinese buffet line."" Mind you they were not serving Chinese food at the buffet. During the morning where they served pastries, muffins, and coffee/tea, the cashier mistook my $20 bill as a $10. I told him that was a $20 so he didn't give me the right change back. He denied it, so I asked him to count his cash box, right then and there. He got angry and hostile until the manager stepped in.

"The Troubadour Hotel New Orleans, Tapestry Collection by Hilton",New Orleans,4.0,"This is a gem of a hotel.  The price is right as well for a legit 4-star hotel.  Stayed last Wed-Sun.  Location was perfect since you're only a 15 minute walk from the bedlum of Bourbon St. and about a 10 min walk to the Warehouse District.  Plenty of good restaurants and other really good hotel bars/restaurants immediately surrounding the hotel everywhere.  A very short walk also to Canal St. where one can catch a streetcar.  

The staff was meh.  Not overly nice but not a bunch of rude or too cool for school people either.  

The room was really sharp, modern, and comfortable.  I've read some reviews about some King rooms being small but mine felt great.  Spacious bathroom with a pretty big walk-in shower.  Bed was very comfy.  Only negative was the quality of the towels in the bathroom.  Really thin and low quality.  Reminiscent of commercial grade dish towels.  Wasn't a huge issue for me but if some diva wants to be pampered then they might be underwhelmed.  The walls seemed a little thin also I'll add.

Really cool rooftop bar that gives you stunning views of the city!!  Worth going up there even if you aren't a guest.

I would definitely stay here again.  It's great value in the CBD and close enough to everything via walking.  Really perfect location for me.",0.2008184523809524
Hilton Philadelphia City Avenue,Philadelphia,1.0,"I booked the bridal suite at the Hilton for my wedding because it was the closest to the venue and I thought I couldn't go wrong with a Hilton. I was so very wrong. The room wasn't ready for check in, even though we came in the late afternoon, and when I got to the room, it was dingy. The armchairs were EXTREMELY worn (think stuffing coming out of the chair), one of the lamps didn't even have a lampshade so it was just a bare bulb, and there wasn't anywhere for me to hang my dress. The photographer had to do some crazy manipulations so the prep pictures didn't look like I was in a motel. I was so embarrassed.

I had arranged for a late check-out so I could have more time to get ready for my wedding, but someone knocked on my door a few minutes after noon was very rude with one of my bridesmaids when she tried to explain to him that we had a late check-out. He didn't even listen to her, just told her that we had to get out of the room and then turned and walked away. As if there isn't enough stress on the wedding day.

This hotel was not worth the ridiculous amount of money that I spent on it and the service certainly did not make the beginning of my wedding day enjoyable.",-0.12021303258145362
JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"The hotel and grounds are absolutely stunning. Unfortunately, the security is lacking and a man at the pool in a cabana exposed his genitalia to me while I was trying to locate the entrance to the pool. The hotels response to the incident has been by far the most disturbing aspect of my ordeal.

I reported the incident to the staff and the supervisor at the pool entrance was attentive to my concerns and assured me she would look into the situation. The authorities were called as the man was intoxicated and had exposed himself to other people near the pool as well. After this point the hotel didn't bother reaching out to me to confirm if I was safe or needed anything. I'm a cancer survivor and amputee, I don't live in the state of Arizona and am traveling alone to attend a national amputee conference that is being hosted at this resort.

I asked to speak to the hotel manager and was met with reluctance and hesitation. I managed to speak with the Director of Hotel Operations, Bill Blodgett, whom became irritated when I pressed for answers as to how this could happen on their grounds and why hotel staff has not been very hospitable or accommodating. I feel very much disregarded and brushed aside by the staff at the JW Marriott Tucson Starr Pass Resort. Mr. Blodgett's demeanor and stance towards me was menacing and I felt very much unwelcome at the hotel by this point. I asked for his supervisor to call me back and he asked for my contact information but did not provide any paper or pens to provide my contact information. Imagine, the director of hotel operations needing to be told to provide pen and paper.... or perhaps maybe take down my contact information himself.

By far the worst hospitality I have ever experienced at any hotel. Obviously, I will not ever stay at a Marriott hotel ever again. This is no way to treat a victim of sexual harassment.",0.04351339481774264
JW MarriottTucson Starr Pass Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"Thanks Starr pass for ruining such an awesome weekend for this Gold Elite member!!!!! Never returning!!!!!! So my bestie came in town for the weekend so I decided do a staycation so that we could enjoy the pool and play golf. Front desk, bell hops, and golf club house service was good. I come here pretty frequently with my friends. This weekend the customer service for food/drinks was at an all time low. It took 45 minutes to get our breakfast at signature grill. Then the kicker...was at the Spa pool. So just some background information. You must be  18 to get in the spa ...first time getting carded.  We went in and put belongings away. One of our friends ordered a round of drinks and was carded again. The drinks took an hour to come. That was no big deal.  Waitress finally comes... and wants to card us again. People let's remember I am in the spa!!!!!!!!  The rest of us had locked our purses up. Think relaxing! Who has every gotten carded this many times at a spa in a hotel?? The waitress was rude as hell. And this was the only time that we carded the entire stay. I got so frustrated and cried. We left the spa. We go talk to the manager and he tried to offer us cabana and totally missed that we did not like customer service!! We were not trying to anything free.

I answered and this rude guy didn't believe we were married and then made another rude comment ""she didn't look like she knew me at all"" There is a difference in our ages and we are good looking happy adults. He made me feel like crap and she cried all night and I never will consider another Marriot again. I just don't know why he didn't give me the respect that he may have been wrong.

3) The room smelled of smoke. (Non smoking room) 

4) no towels in the pool area. 

5) They turned off the lights in the pool area at closing which is fine but they gave us NO heads up and we had to wait on towels.

Four Points by Sheraton Suites Tampa Airport Westshore,Tampa,3.0,"From a location standpoint and huge rooms for the price you can't go wrong staying here.  When we arrived it reminded me of an Embassy Suites with all the rooms facing the atrium. We had requested an early check in which did not happen.  We did wind up getting one room but the other room was not available until 5 pm.  The staff (receptionist) who answered the phone when our friend called to check on the status of his room was very rude to him.  This gave us a bad impression of the hotel and the service we were getting. 

The rooms are huge with a seating area, refrigerator, sink and a desk then the bedroom was so large.   It was a great size but they really needed to add some dressers as there was a very small dresser with four tiny drawers for clothing.  Plenty of room for a large dresser or any kind of furniture to take up some space.  The beds are very comfy with nice linen and good pillows. 

The rooms were clean, although the carpet had a funny smell to me. Then again carpet grosses me out.  The elevators take forever as we were on the third floor and had to depend on them. One of the main reasons was there were a ton of kids running around like lunatics all day and night.  They kept getting in the elevators riding them up and down, running through the hallways etc.... RUGRATS, at it's best.  It seemed they were there on some kind of a meet so they were with chaperones who obviously let these brats do whatever they wanted. 

Several guest complained about them to the front desk but nothing was done.  All in all we were happy with the price we paid and the location.  The service needs some attention no doubt.  It's decent to stay here just bring your patience!",0.17082275132275132
Hyatt Centric French Quarter New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"So a couple of things. 1st off... don't stay here if you enjoy privacy & respect. When we left the room one day to go to Jazz Fest the maid floor manager (or at least she spoke  to the other maids as if that's her role) was standing outside in the hall and gave us a nasty look. Then about 5-10 min later one of my buddies went back up to the room and was confronted by 2 security guards who said ""what's your room number"" as if they were the police. 

He told them and then they said that one of the staff members complained about a smoke smell?!?... they then escorted him to the room so they could  search for themselves!?! Obviously there was no smell b/c none of us are smokers AND the room windows are locked shut so you couldn't smoke if you wanted to!!! So they searched and found nothing, but I have NEVER had a hotel search a room like the fu*cking FBI!?! 

So invasive and rude... not even a phone call... just confronting guests at random in the hallway and asking what room they're in + searching it... and two huge security guards... honestly?!? 

2nd problem... MOLD... all over the bathtub... soooo nasty to think that other people's filth isn't getting cleaned up for next customer... makes you wonder how nasty the rug & beds really are. 

Anyway, NOLA is kinda a dirty town anyway, so we rode out the last night there instead of moving all our stuff. 

But I would NEVER recommend this place to other people... especially for the $300 bones a night they bill. Stay at a holiday inn and you'd get the same quality room... only difference is the Holiday Inn won't SEARCH guests rooms and they cost a lot less.

I think the whole hotel management industry in New Orleans is pretty bad, unfriendly, and unorganized, but this Courtyard Marriott is managed perfectly fine.  The valet service here wasn't extremely friendly nor helpful, but it was fine.  The rooms seemed really new and modernized, so I think maybe the rooms were remodeled recently.

Hyatt Centric French Quarter New Orleans,New Orleans,3.0,"I am still undecided on how to review this hotel. Did I love the location and the hotel itself, yes. 

I think being located right off Bourbon makes this hotel a great location to stay at and it is very nice. However, not having to pay for my stay makes me a little more biased to the good side. However friends who paid to stay are having a horrible time with their bill. 

So be weary of the prices and look at your bill, I hear they charge and over charge. 
The valet per night is $42 and to park in public garages is $30 per night. So I couldn't really say it was to much more than other places but it is steep when your parking your car and staying a few nights. 

The rooms were nice, we got a room off the pool deck which I think cut down on our traffic and noise. However, it's February so it's not like a major big deal cause we didn't use the pool just had more patio space. 

I didn't have to deal with staff at all but I felt everyone was very nice. We had to wear bands to prove we were residents during our stay or you were not let in the front doors. 
The rooms were no big deal. We did get to participate in a party room that had a balcony that overlooked Bourbon Street. From the looks of the bill the mark up on liquor provided to the room through a contract by the hotel was marked up over 100%, they made more than enough of the drinks. 

So it's a nice stay with a lot of convenience but it's pricey and they will add to your bill if you don't watch out. Since I didn't pay myself I am a little more appreciative then those who did dish out their own funds.",0.2590235260770975

Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Near the French Quarter,New Orleans,3.0,"I stayed here recently and it was odd from my arrival. When I arrived the valet guy literally ignored me while he continued to speak with a group of gentleman. After I stood behind him for a couple of minutes while I waited for them to get finished flirting, the valet then turned to me and starting assisting me. In the midst of him signing me up he asked if I wanted to go out with him for his birthday, I explained I couldn't because my fiancé was on his way then he started yelling at me calling me a liar. He told me he was bisexual anyway(which had nothing to do with our convo) then I slowly walked away and to the front desk. 

The front desk staff wasn't too friendly but were efficient. However, when I got off their rinky dink elevators and got to my room I was immediately turned off. The rooms are incredibly small and horribly outdated. Not to mention, the drawer didn't close in the dresser, the closet door didn't open and there was hair and rubber bands on the floor, in the shower and in the sink. I was grossed out to say the least. I asked for a room move which I was denied but was offered drink tickets (that I never received)...The engineer and housekeeping staff came immediately to take care of the issues but I was still pretty unhappy with my experience so far. 

I then walked down to the bar where I paid for my drink that were supposed to be complimentary and was pretty upset until I met the wonderful bartender Romell... he literally turned my stay around.

Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Near the French Quarter,New Orleans,3.0,"This hotel is ok.  For the price, you can and should probably do better.

It's only a block from the Quarter so that is good.  But the rooms are dinky and the fixtures are old (but our room was clean enough).  I also didn't like the fact that the plumbing fixtures, like the shower arm, were completely separated from the wall stucco.  Maybe that is so you can hose down your bedroom or something if you yank the shower arm out of the wall far enough.  The staff is not overly friendly but not rude.  Our room was ""non-smoking"" but kind of still smelled like smoke which is a very big issue for some people.

And the joint is LOUD.  The design of the hotel, which allows the room doors to face or be ""open"" to the front lobby down below, is sheer madness.  When you know that drunk crazies are going to be coming in and out at all hours, and the soundproofing of your room sucks, rest assured that you pretty much will not rest well because you will hear everything from the lobby all night long.  Maybe that's an amenity for some folks, but not for me.

For the same price as a night here, you can probably get a room at the Sheraton, right around the corner, and by way of comparison for the two hotels, you will think you have entered heaven as you walk into the Sheraton.

Cons: When we were checking in, the desk clerk was very rude and argumentative. Her attitude was less than helpful. The complimentary internet is dreadfully slow and requires re-logging on often.

Fairfield Inn by Marriott Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,2.0,"My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights recently to attend our friend's graduation from Widener.  

PROS
We arrived around 1 pm, which is well before the 4 pm check-in time, but our room was ready for us and were able to check in anyway.  The woman who checked us in was nice, patient, and efficient.

The room itself was nice.  The bathroom was clean, well-stocked with towels and travel-size toiletries including individually wrapped makeup remover towelettes, which really made me happy as I had forgotten to pack mine.  We had a room with two queen beds, which were very comfortable and had nice, crisp, white sheets and bedding.  Also, the extra pillows we had requested in our reservation were already on each bed.  

I really liked having a mini-fridge in the room. This allowed us to keep beverages and leftovers from the Ruby Tuesday next door (an easy two-minute walk away) cold.

We were given a $75 credit on our bill for having to put up with multiple spiders in our room (see explanation below in the CONS section).

MINOR ISSUES
The flat screen TV had great picture quality although some channels broadcast considerably louder than others (beware or you may accidentally anger your neighbors).

It would have been nice to have a microwave in the room to heat up leftovers.  As we were staying on the 4th floor, we did not feel like walking all the way down the hall, taking the elevator, using the microwave in the breakfast area, then going all the way back to our room after a long day of sightseeing and visiting with friends.  We were worn out!  

There was apparently a small colony of unknown species of spider taking up residence in room 430.  I woke up both nights to one or two small spiders crawling on my arms.  Also, there were a few spiders spinning webs near the ceiling over the shower.  My husband, however, never noticed them.

CONS
Although the air conditioner was running almost constantly, the humidity in our room never diminished.  It always felt damp and sticky in there.  Each morning, we were eager to shower, dress, and leave the room just to get away from the humidity.  When we did hang out in the room, we turned the air conditioner down to 68 in order to feel comfortable.

We had requested a ground floor room in our reservation but did not receive one at check-in.  Also, the desk attendant did not acknowledge our request, nor did she explain why she was unable to grant it.  

There was a busload of student athletes staying in the hotel at the same time as us and they all but took over the hotel and ran amuck.  The chaperones as well as the students were loud, rude, inconsiderate, and acted as if they ran the place.  At breakfast on Saturday, the kids were taking up 80% of the seats in the breakfast area, talking exceedingly loudly, and the chaperones had taken up an entire long bar-like table with their own coolers of drinks and cardboard boxes full of fruit from Costco.  They were taking up valuable seats and floor space!  When people in that group finished eating, they did not leave.  Rather, they just hung out continuing to be loud and obnoxious.  The hotel staff did nothing to quiet the din, encourage those who were done eating to leave so that other guests could sit down to eat (many were standing or leaning against walls at this point), nor did the staff ask the kids to not break the lines waiting for food to be restocked.  It was a nightmare!

The next day, the pool was overrun with teenagers being loud and crowding the small indoor space.  So, we gave up on ever using our pool passes and my husband promises that we will try to go swimming again on our next trip.  I was very disappointed.

The windows in our room did hardly anything to dampen the sound from the road right outside.  We heard cars with loud mufflers, cars peeling out at the green light, and the trains that went by on the train track adjacent to the road.  We hardly ever heard the airplanes coming in to land at the nearby airport, though, which is weird.  On our last night, a huge helicopter buzzed the hotel right after we had fallen asleep and startled us awake.  Our room was noisy!  Also, anyone talking or walking down the hall can be heard from far away and we heard every door on our floor open and close.  It was very hard to sleep except between 11 pm and 6 am.

I didn't believe for one second that this hotel is worth the price we paid.  For $169 a night, I expect low humidity, a nice peaceful breakfast with adequately stocked food containers at all times, staff to ensure that guests are courteous to one another, and that younger guests are asked to behave accordingly when they get out of hand.

We were charged $26.20 per day in occupancy and city taxes, which amounted to nearly $75 in unexpected charges.  So, after our room rebate is considered, we were only refunded the tax money we paid and did not actually receive a discount for the lower than expected quality of our room.",0.0873389077853363
Holiday Inn Philadelphia Stadium,Philadelphia,1.0,"How do I review this hotel?  Well, let's see...

Do I start with 3 stars?

It was very clean.  +1*

Because they are located right next to the Phillies stadium they decided it would be a good idea to sell their parking spaces during games.  Annoying because there are always people tailgating and then drinking until all hours of the night when there is a game.  Not to mention they block all but one parking lot entrance, so good luck getting in or out.  Erg.  -1*

The service was so awful.  Allow me to elaborate.  -1*  
---When we checked in the guy handed me the room keys and asked if I had any questions.  I asked for my credit card.  He responded, ""Well, I have to imprint it first.""  You know what?  I don't give a rip what you have to do with it.  I just need the card back.  How about you lose the attitude, imprint the damn card real quick, which will take about one whole second and hand it to me.  Arg.  
---The next morning my husband asks if they need any info on the car.  The woman tells him yes, hands him a parking permit dated for today only.  He explains we are there for 4 days, she says we cannot have one dated until Sunday.  I ask if we have to come back again, she says we have to return every day and get a new pass every single day.  Are you serious with this crap?  What is this injustice?!?!
---On the third day we actually drive out of the lot for the first time.  When we return there is someone checking tags and taking payment for the people going to the game.  My husband tells the lady he is a registered guest, she responds with, what is your name, when did you check in, when are you checking out, where is your parking permit with today's date?  At this point I am ready to go off.  I am saying ""Oh no, I am not going over that with her.  We paid to park here!""  Grr. 

Hmm, I guess I am out of stars.  

Bottom line, want to go for the game?  Don't mind rude service and hassle every step of the way?  Then this is the place for you; you won't be disappointed.",-0.041586804000597104
Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Near the French Quarter,New Orleans,4.0,"In retrospect, this Courtyard was overall a very good hotel.  It's located right on the dividing line between the Central Business District and The French Quarter.  What that means is that you could essentially spend your entire trip here and never need a car.  The Quarter, the Fauborg Marigny, and the French Market are all in easy walking distance.  Not only that, the hotel is right across from a stop for the St Charles Avenue Streetcar.  So, for $1.25, you can ride the streetcar uptown and explore the Garden District and the Tulane area.  If you're driving in, the bad part is that parking is scarce in the CBD, so you will be paying $30 per day for valet parking.  I had a bad experience here one day where the front desk had made a mistake and called me at 6:30 AM asserting that I was supposed to check out the day before when in fact I still had 3 more days there!  That really upset me because afterwards we had housekeepers and others banging on our door at 7 AM thinking we weren't there.  My day of sleep was ruined.  The lady at the front desk was kind of rude because she said I needed to produce a print out of my confirmation to prove that I belonged there.  Luckily, another employee who checked me in came in to work and straightened out this lady and fixed the record.  That experience sucked but I would say that overall the staff was really friendly and helpful.  The rooms were comfy and my room overlooked St Charles Avenue, so everything else was great.

He was incredibly pleasant, helpful, kind, gave us recommendations for the area AND interacted with both overly tired toddler. 

That night we went to their pool to swim. It was fantastic!! Very very clean and organized. Not huge, but it was a nice space. 

The room was large and quite accommodating. The doors to the bathrooms were a bit weird though. Very very hard to close (got to keep toddlers out of the potty!) the kitchenette was perfect us and had everything we needed.  Their was an odd window that led to some strange hallway/atrium/pathway where the lights never turned off. Even with the black out shades you could still see light. 

We ordered pizza for delivery and I waited in the lobby. Nathan, the front desk clerk, was not the most pleasant person. I was listening to him interact with customers in person and on the phone. He seems very rude and quite short with them. I was thankful that wasn't my check in experience. 

Breakfast in the morning was fine. A decent selection for continental. There was definitely not enough seating, but perhaps this was dramatized because of the hotels sell out. 

Lastly, we had valeted our car. We texted the number and only had to wait about 10 minutes to get it back. The valet men were incredible!!! Taylor, the manager, was so nice. Had a conversation with us. Asked if we needed help or directions. Even interacted with our kids. They held car doors open for us to put our kids in their car seats. They were lovely.

Residence Inn by Marriott Tucson Airport,Tucson,2.0,"I upgraded to a one-bedroom suite and really loved the layout.  I'm used to staying at the Residence Inn on Speedway, so this review is a direct comparison to that one.  Both have super-nice service at check-in.  They always go out of their way to give you directions, explain the hotel, etc.  The Residence Inn at Speedway has the old-fashioned townhouse-like rooms.  I never bother getting a suite there so this was a real treat at the Residence Inn at the airport.    This is where the comparison starts to get a little strange.  At the Residence Inn at Speedway the woman that does the breakfast is SO NICE.  She's always running back and forth, making sure that the eggs are fresh, if anyone needs help, etc.  The woman at the Residence Inn at the airport could not care less.  I stopped eating breakfast there rather than dealing with her and her over-peppered eggs.  On Monday, we were out of eggs at 7:00 AM (breakfast was supposed to start at 6:30) and I had to get to work.  She just looked at me and said, ""What do you want me to do?""  ....uhhhh make some eggs?  Maybe?  Then they ran out of coffee.

Hyatt Centric French Quarter New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"I stayed at the Hyatt for my best friend's bachelorette party.  I was the organizer and had 4 rooms booked.  I called the Monday before our trip and requested that our rooms be placed near each other and that we have early check-in.  Obviously these things are all based on availability.

When I arrived at 1pm on Friday, none of our rooms were ready.  I asked again for early check-in and was told our rooms would be ready ""shortly"".  Also, since I was the first to arrive, I asked that my room be ready first.  The front desk said they would call me as each of the rooms became available. 

My friend and I dropped off our bags with the hotel and headed for lunch.  After lunch we headed back to the hotel bar to have a drink while waiting for the hotel to let us know that at least one room was available.  Around 2:30pm, the remainder of our party showed up (and well, ready to party), so I inquired with the front desk again.  One room had been ready to go (I received no phone call), and they were finishing up a second.  I took the keys and send the girls up to store their bags, while I continued to wait for the other two rooms.  Despite me checking in repeatedly at the front desk, the third room became available at 3:30pm (check-in begins at 3pm) and the last room (which was my room despite my asking for it to be first and all 4 rooms being identical) became avail at 4pm.  While I understand that early check-in is based upon availability, it is absolutely possible to have the cleaning staff clean certain rooms first.  In addition, it is important to manage your guests expectations when they make these requests - when I hear ""shortly,"" I expect something in the next 20-30 mins.  Not 3 hours later.

The topping on the cake was when the staff brought out our bags from storage.  My friend had brought a couple of bottles of alcohol, which she was carrying in a box for a case of wine.  She had checked this with the hotel while we waited for our rooms to become ready.  When the staff brought out our bags, he informed us that there would be a corkage fee charged on our wine to bring it into the hotel (keep in mind what we had was in a closed box so he was either assuming based on the box or had opened the box to inspect).  He said he had to get the director of operations to tell us what the corkage fee was.  He was extremely rude to us (and not to mention, no one bothered to tell us about this at any point beforehand, including when we dropped off our bags).  He had yet to actually bring out our box and was keeping it hostage in the back.  He did bring out some of our nonalcoholic drinks (water, soda, etc) and left behind the front desk and refused to give to us.  At this point, I was already extremely upset about how our early check-in (or, even past 3pm, general check-in) to our rooms was being handled.  A more senior staff member arrived and seeing that the situation had turned significantly worse, advised that no corkage fee would be charged.  Btw, I have NEVER heard of a hotel charging a corkage fee to bring alcohol into your room.

At this point, we then demand the rest of our belongings be brought out to us.  Of course, the ""corkage fee"" staff member who had started this mess was no where to be found so we tried to explain to the manager what we're missing (including the items that were still behind the front desk).  ""Corkage fee"" guy reappears only to stand off to the side and, I kid you not, flex at my friend (who is female).  I have never experienced such a lack of respect and blatant attitude anywhere.

I would love to give this review a 1 star, but given the quality of the hotel rooms, the  location, the hotel/pool bar staff, I had to be fair.  However, the staff needs to get it together (and in some cases, need a real attitude check) - at $300 plus a night, you don't have a bunch of schmucks staying there.

Residence Inn by Marriott Tampa Westshore/Airport,Tampa,2.0,"Stayed here on a quick overnight before an early flight from TPA.  I stayed at the Westshore Grand the previous night, but had to extend my trip and it was sold out the second night, so I booked the Residence Inn by the airport.

One of the front desk staff was very rude upon check in - my guess is it was the same person that others on here have complained about as everyone else was very friendly.  After she walked away the other front desk agent who witnessed it apologized and was very friendly.

As a Marriott Titanium member I'm used to being given rooms on a high floor with view or a bigger room - the ""best available"" room basically.  I was given a room on a low floor (2 or 3, I forget) with a direct view of the roof and HVAC equipment of the lobby building.  As this was a quick overnight stay and I didn't want to deal with the first front desk person again I did not ask to change rooms.  But, it would have been nice if she would have taken the time to proactively look for something better as most front desk staff do at the various Marriott's I have stayed at.

The room needs to be updated.  it seems they may have updated part of it but left other parts untouched (very dated wood cabinets that are beat up).  I didn't expect this to be the St. Regis, but have stayed at other Residence Inn's that were nicer.

The location is a very quick drive to/from Tampa Airport. There is a Fleming's Steakhouse - which never disappoints - and a Roy's right next door.  There are a number of other good restaurants at the International Mall, which is a quick drive or Uber away.

I had a very early flight and hopped on the hotel shuttle that was right on time at 5:15am.  Front desk agent and driver were both very friendly and they already had coffee brewed up.

AC Hotel by Marriott Tucson Downtown,Tucson,1.0,"Do not waste your money!! This hotel and it's awful management was the worst hotel experience I have ever had!! We have started a tradition for the past 5 years of getting a hotel room for me daughter to celebrate her birthday. We invite family and some of her friends in every hotel we have ever stayed in. But because this time they were teenagers, they completely  discriminated against them and harassed me the rest of the time we were there. We had a group of teenagers in the room to surprise my daughter, they were in the room, with 3 adults for maybe an hour, then they left. The staff came to me after 2 and a half hours after the kids left, I brought them down with me in the elevator to leave, and said there had been a noise complaint. I asked why it took over 2 hrs to tell me this they said they didn't have phone number that in my  reservation through a second party it did not save my phone number. The group of kids never returned, after it was my son my niece and I in our hotel room, management came up again to state that the room capacity was only three people. When I asked if they ever had any kind of bachelor parties or bridal showers or anything of that nature in any of their rooms and the rooms had more than three people in them they stated that never happens at that hotel. I even asked the cleaning staff on the floor if they in fact clean rooms were big parties have come and they said yes. They continue to harass me throughout my stay even though the group of Kids that were there for literally maybe an hour had left 45 hours previously. I have never been treated so poorly I have never felt so attacked I have never stayed in a place where you could not have more people in your hotel room. They had no microwave to warm up any food the staff didn't give me any information when I checked in about how much they were putting a hold on my card what time the bar hours were for any information that had to do with the hotel except for how to use my key card to get to my room. All the photos online are completely deceiving everything is way smaller the pool is teeny tiny and the rooms were very small I would never suggest anybody to stay at this hotel",-0.023739711934156364
TownePlace Suites by Marriott Tampa South,Tampa,1.0,"AVOID AVOID AVOID AT ALL MEANS!! 
If I could rate this hotel ""1 star "" I would ! I am a titanium member who stays at mainly Marriott brand hotels over 100 days per year so I have corporate expectations as well as being extremely familiar in protocol. The young man who checked me on day one was wonderful ...he seemed very well and freshly  trained almost like he spoke as if he was reading a script (franchised location had only been open for approx 5 weeks) He thanked me for my loyalty etc. etc. explained my welcome points and then offered me the upgrade to the two bedroom due to my status and a complimentary bag of gourmet popcorn!  The next morning I went downstairs with the app opened and asked if an upgrade was available again if I were extend another night and it was a different young man and he said yes it was and I said can I book the AAA  ""lowest rate"" available and he said , ""sure the upgrade was available....""  then about an hour later I came downstairs with the room keys to re-key the cards and he said he had a problem and he had to wait for the manager to do the upgrade so we left to riverwalk for a few hours but James Bailey the manager went upstairs to the room when my husband and I were gone to QUOTE ON QUOTE Check a ""water leak ""   As he {without my permission } went through MY ROOM to search for an extra charge he could  tack on to make up the difference .... to get it closer to the amount they wanted for the 2 bedroom /$400 room.  I was supposedly being upgraded from the AAA rate of $150 -

I found out form my younger brother when we pulled into the parking lot all the shenanigans; unauthorized entering of my room; scare tactics; going on and OF COURSE I WENT STRAIGHT TO THE FRONT DESK AND DEMANDED TO MEET MY UNAUTHORIZED INTRUDER- James bailey (the manager ).. HE looked confused when I confronted him he was shaking/pupils HUGE/ jaw shivering / hand shaking and my brother was not with me but yet he kept saying your brother admitted it he smoking inside the hotel hallway ?!  It was not until I said ""I am not paying a fee for something  never happened"" that he said he was going to call the police -I said show me footage , he said he never actually physically saw him but that my brother came up to him and told him that he was smoking inside the hallway ??  He then said I don't care if you are a platinum member it doesn't mean you get special treatment and I specifically said I don't know why you're bringing that up and by the way -I'm a TITANIUM . It was such a Bizzarre conversation I told him to go ahead and please call the police if that's what he needed to do because he wasn't making sense AT ALL and at first he just picked up his cell phone and was playing with it not calling anyone 
I truly believe that he thought he would just add the fee to compensate for the rate I was charged because clearly the upgrade was part of ""special treatment"" I was not eligible for.  This location does not ethically handle the corporate protocol for Marriott with deceptive tactics of entering rooms and ""creating"" bogus accusations to add charges when they feel an ineligible upgrade is being extended. I have never in my whole life been treated so poorly, manipulated and humiliated. I have never in my whole life ever even touched a cigarette.

I booked the Best Western Airport Suites in Indianapolis for my son's football team as we traveled for a tournament. We booked 5 suites for approx. 30 people (20+ children). As we walked into the hotel, there was a short man of middle-eastern descent standing at the doorway scowling. YES, YOU HEARD ME RIGHT. Neither greeting nor thanking us for staying as the establishment. He was standing with his arms folding with a rude expression. As the end of the line neared, I heard him say ""oh no, I don't want them to stay here... we put up with this last weekend... etc."" I immediately turned around and asked what the issue was. And he started ranting saying that we could not stay there because he couldn't have 8 or 9 people staying in each room. No more than 4 people could stay in the rooms and we have way too many people to have only booked 5 rooms. (yes, 8 people x 5 rooms= 40 people so his math was way off smh). So, I kindly refuting his claim with the facts- we booked 5 suites which sleep 6 people each. He went back and forth trying to pressure us to leave for about 10 minutes, printing receipts with ""policies"", etc. that were all bs. And we honestly would have if we didn't have a team of kids who's been traveling all day. I am not sure if it was the initial perception of a group of African American people entering the hotel or what but it was clear that we were not welcomed at this Best Western. From there, the owner/manager refused to provide us with clean towels and wash cloths during our stay. We caught him several times standing outside our room doors randomly. When I called before our stay, we were told that since the buffet style breakfast is closed due to COVID, there would be ""grab bags"" provided for us, which I assumed would include cereal bars, fruit, juice maybe. No such thing was available or provided to us. Two of our rooms had an infestation of ants, which I tried to maintain by wiping surfaces with fabuloso and bleach to no avail. Our electricity in one room kept clicking off at the breaker and the manager took his time tending to the issue. The bathrooms were dingy and the water pressure in the hotel was bad.

Trip to celebrate our Fortieth anniversary!

Day one, Wednesday 3/27/19: Late check in- dropped bags and went out. We were expecting champagne and strawberries when we returned that I ordered on line!!!!! I called the front desk and was told they had no record even though I had phone conversation 2 days previous with manager Elliot. They didn't even ask if I would like them sent up!
Unpack clothes.
Room not cleaned very well. There was a huge beam/post in the middle of room that I didn't bargain on and I smashed my right knee into post middle of night. I stopped at front desk to express my dismay. Received call that we will be moved to a different room.
Repack clothes.

Day two, Thursday 3/28/19: 
Transferred to new room. Unpack clothes not knowing its location to Bourbon Street and the noise level.

Windows were so filthy we didn't even have a decent view. The noise level was so severe it kept us awake past 4am followed with garbage trucks. We were then awakened @ 8am by delivery trucks and people shouting and blowing horns. Ear plugs were useless!

Day 3, Friday 3/29/19 : I went to front desk and talked with manager Johanna and told her my wife was in the room crying! Johanna stated she would take care of first two nights and change our room again. She explained we would receive a text when the new room was ready. Repack clothes.

When we were going out for the day Johanna did come up to us and apologized to my wife. 
We returned late afternoon and went to the front desk to inquire about our new room because we had not received a text. We were told the room was ready and given the keys and went upstairs to find that our luggage had not been transferred as promised. We went back to our old room to retrieve our belongings. Door was open because housekeeping staff was cleaning old room! 
Unpack clothes again!
We did manage to have a Peaceful and quiet night. 

Day four, Saturday 3/30/19 : Tolerated the usual drunks stumbling into our door a few times between 10 & 12. Was rudely awakened around 1:30 am to total chaos in hallways. Tried calling front desk and operator for twenty minutes to no avail. Finally got an answer around 2am and security was on the way. At 2:15 I went into the hallway looking for security. I found him down another hallway and asked for his help on our hallway. Obviously there was more than one incident in progress on our floor.

I asked an employee later in the day about my ""no answer "" situation and was told ""they don't have much of a night staff at front desk, maybe one person only"". WOW! What a disappointment.

Later that afternoon I had to ask housekeeping staff cleaning the room across the hall why we only received decaf coffee. She explained she didn't have regular coffee for our room so I had to chase a housekeeping cart down the hall. Not happy! WOW!

Day 5, Sunday 3/31/19: Due to exhaustion and lack of sleep, we thought it would be nice to have room service. This proved to be a very bad decision. The worst breakfast ever. 

Potatoes were old, dried out and mealy. Probably sitting in a warmer for hours. Toast was was nothing more than soggy bread that was steamed inside plastic box dome! 

Nothing was hot, just warm. Had to call back and ask for salt and pepper for our eggs. Staff brought me a huge handful of utensil packages and was told I would find salt and pepper inside them. By this time, everything was so cold, I threw what was presented as breakfast away. 

I was so upset and distraught at this point I fell ill in the bathroom! I was so freaked out I didn't even bother calling front desk because I feared I would lose my composure. 

Came back to our room later that afternoon to find only decaf coffee AGAIN AND CHASED ANOTHER HOUSEKEEPING CART FOR COFFEE...AGAIN!
 
Day 6, Monday 4/1/19:
Returned to room in evening to REPEAT ON COFFEE so I had to go down to exchange at front desk. DOUBLE WOW!

We were compensated two nights lodging, for that we are grateful. They also removed internet charges that never should have been there. Unfortunately,  the room charge gift will never erase the bad experience or eradicate the frustrating memories.

This Marriott literally brings armed guards to kick you and yours out of the pool area. While I understand limits and rules, 9pm on a Saturday night seems a bit extreme.  They advise you, instead, to sit in front of the building on the benches. This is ridiculous for many reasons. 

Furthermore, the guard, Dave, was especially rude. He threatened us all with bodily harm if we did not move. Now, Dave, wait a minute. We paid to stay here but you are going to harm us if we don't comply?  Really, Marriott, is that your guest service pledge?  You give us money. We take the money. We can do whatever we want.   Good one.  

Also, if you are looking for an exceptionally clean room, this is not it. I watched the same debris on the carpet hang out for days.  I guess I should have cleaned that. After all, I paid for the room.

I mean could they have not said we need to carry our bags up 3 floors? Rude but whatever. We get to our Room and go out on to the balcony after unpacking and have a cigaret. Apparently the manager needed to put his remote down again comes and banging on our door and when I opened it he said you're smoking in here and we said we were actually smoking on the balcony and he said you're not allowed to do that we apologized but that was not enough for him he started screaming at us asking where we were from when we said Edmonton he said then you know the law is 5' from any building! After screaming at us the way or mother used to we thought whatever again. The night staff with actually really nice to us so we thought we would give it another try as our booking was for 2 days. We arrived back the same evening Friday after our mother's birthday which was why we were in town to begin with to find 2 crackheads parked in the parking lot ripping apart bikes smoking yes I said smoking in the underground parking. There was a total of 8 vehicles in a parking area meant for 12 so we were told we had to park up stairs. Not only did we have to walk past these crackheads taking over these parking spaces with their bicycles and all of their krapp but the next morning we had to go around Another shopping cart to get up stairs to our vehicle when we get upstairs not only was there another guy unloading his shopping cart all over this parking space but we found 3 cigar butts on the hood of our car. We have stayed at this overpriced hotel several times when visiting our family in Calgary  Smoking was never a problem when we were on the balcony which is why we booked here again. We could have stayed for the exact same price at the Gray Eagle casino If we had of known what a hothead this manager was not to mention abusive we would have stayed there. This is the1st 24 hours of a 48 hour booking. If i hadn't prepaid we would have been out of here,-0.023680555555555555
Four Points by Sheraton Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,2.0,"The front desk staff was very nice & helpful since I've never stayed at this location.  However, the bar/restaurant was another story.  My first clue shoulda been-hey it's just past HHr but there's only 3 patrons here..... but, I was hungry.  There was no one within 10 ft of me when I walked up to place my order.  The bartender-I think was named Chris, said ""hey you can't stand there"".  I looked around as if he was speaking so rudely to someone else but, noooooo he meant me.  I said I just want to see a menu.  He said you need to stand over here.  This guy was so rude, no wonder there were only 3 patrons.  I had an ok turkey club, bread was so hard I threw it away but the flavor was good.  Martini was ok, no blue cheese olives.
My coworkers told me this guy was rude to them too, they walked across the parking lot to A Loft & had a nicer/polite experience.  I paid $30 for a $15 snack.....",0.0991025641025641
Courtyard by Marriott,Philadelphia,1.0,"Experience worthy of a roadside motel in the middle of nowhere renting rooms by the hour.  Mold and mildew in the shower.  No towels after two days even after I asked for them. Trash in the room not cleared after two days.

No explanation.  No apology.  Just attitude from the Operations Manager who just told me, ""I'm trying to help you.""

Now, when you read that, the assumption might be I was being a jerk; yelling, screaming or otherwise making a scene.  I was not.  I was in hotel management for three years.  I know how difficult some guests can be and I am sensitive to that.  My voice never rose, I was never discourteous or disrespectful.  I did leave the bag of trash that was never removed from my room on the desk to make the point, but even that was not aggressive or rude.

Holiday Inn Tampa Westshore - Airport Area,Tampa,2.0,"I needed to stay at a hotel in Tampa for one night before an early flight. I am part of the IHG loyalty program and wanted to stay in that family hoping to get my elite perks. If you stop reading here, choose another property. This one isn't worth old enough the lowest rate. 

What I liked: The lobby is bright and clean. Decorated for the holidays at this time of year. Rooms were clean, but small. Location close to the airport. Free parking. 

What I didn't like: Breakfast is not complimentary and doesn't start until 7am. No water at check in even for their most loyal customers. In fact, no water fountains anywhere. Staff wasn't necessarily rude as other reviewers said, but they were not friendly or welcoming either either. 

My most unfavorite part was being woken up by screaming, loud guests every hour from 1am to 4am. I did call the front desk and they kindly promised it would be taken care of. It was not. The clientele here was like none I've ever seen. Very sketchy and random.

Fairfield Inn by Marriott Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,1.0,"If I could provide a negative rating, I would. Where to start. This hotel is not worthy of a Marriott Franchise backing.  Don't be misled Marriott frequenters. This place is beyond run down and very little care has been invested into this property. 

Checking in, we had to wait for the front desk associate to finish up his call, while leaning up against his car that he parks under the front overhang (nice valet touch for him). Once we checked in, I provided him my ID and credit card... he ignored it and said it's not needed. Nice enough guy, but it's apparent he doesn't enjoy his job. 

The hallways have a horrible musty smell and are dirty and dated. However, a step up from my room. (Be sure to check out my pictures)

The room was absolutely disgusting. 
Carpet - stained/worn to the wood
Curtain - mold and nasty finger prints
Walls - dirty/ finger prints/smears every where. 
Bed Skirt -stained (don't want to know)
Bathroom -Sink Cracked, Tiles Cracked
Shower - Mold/ empty soap dispenser
Bed comforter- stained 
Smell - mildew and smoke

This is an absolute joke. All night long, doors slamming, people yelling in the hallways, people hanging out in the parking lot all night. BTW, parking lot had trash everywhere. The highlight of this stay was leaving at 6am. 

I was traveling with three other work associates and all three said their rooms were equally gross and in a similar state. 

There are other hotels within a block. Do yourself a favor and pick one of those. I am definitely not one to complain about hotels in the business categories, but this hotel needs to be immediately addressed by Marriott and the franchise rights should be pulled.

Room was average but morning is a disaster. Breakfast isn't kept stocked and the lady stopped even trying after 830. The black lady at the front desk was just about the rudest- no, is the rudest Marriott employee I have ever met - and I have almost 1000 nights in their hotels. She comes across as hating white people. Just an awful experience. They put a 250 dollar hold on my card for one night incidentals - that is a lot of skittles from the pantry.

Best Western InnSuites Tucson Foothills Hotel & Suites,Tucson,1.0,"This was my husband and my favorite hotel until last week. We stayed at this hotel many times and have recommended this establishment even this last weekend two of their rooms were booked based on our recommendations. We booked a jacuzzi suite for our 27th aniversery because the night we married we stayed with this hotel. Mind you a month early and a smoking room like we had in February when we stayed for Valentine's day. 

 When we arrived I explained this to the front office. We went to our room to find another person's clothing in our room, we called the front desk,two hours later and after another call to the front desk someone came and got the clothing. The jacuzzi was very low on water and construction was going on all around us  very loud construction. We went to the front desk to ask when the smoking policy changed and to ask why we had to call for the email confirmation that changed our room type on October 1 when we booked September 1? The front end person turned us over to a very rude and loud manager who told us we could leave.i was upset that they would treat return guests so badly. I guess the new general manager just doesn't care for his guests if he will allow managers to treat guests like they should just put up with bad service, dirty rooms and a jacuzzi that is broken? We left and went back to our room as this was our aniversery and we planned to have family from out of town meet us late on Friday so leaving was not a viable option.  The construction went on over our head and up and down the whole aisle we were surrounded by banging sawing cutting drilling the whole time early morning to late in the evening. Listening to bad language from the workers and smelling strong odors of pot almost like clockwork at 7:30 pm. I guess that type of smoking is allowed.

The housekeeper  never had towels or toilet paper on her cart, and I had to call many times but it did eventually come about two hours later, each time. The last day we had to use tissues because no toilet paper would come. The jucuzzie was so low on water maintenance would come add water and chemicals to the spa,30 minutes later the spa was so cold we could not use it called again they retuned to tell us the accidentally turned the pump off and they wanted it to be perfect but it was NOT  perfect it was unusable.  The manager of maintenance said we would get 2000 bonus points  but have not gotten them. We used the spa on our aniversery  the 6th only to be chemically burned both us to the point we needed medication and we are still trying to heal. We left Sunday to receive a call from someone at the hotel stating she was sorry and she would call me back but now it is Tuesday and still no customer service here? 

I was told more than once they would make some forms of adjustment for this horrible experience but guess what nothing was done, no one called and everytime I was told it was up to the general manager  not a word, but charged our credit card full price for a room we could not use without injury. Like I said this used to be my favorite place to spend with my spouse,  but after this anniversary I am looking for a place where we are welcome and can use toilet paper.",-0.022364460935889507
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,3.0,"First of all, I must disagree with some of the other reviewers about this hotel. We found the physical plant to be quite well done...contemporary and elegant in a corporate way. It did seem the hotel has been relatively recently renovated. The rooms are spacious, well thought-out, and comfortable. There is down bedding, a flat-screen, and a marble bathroom. Frankly, I was surprised This was a Sheraton. And the location was really great with the trolley line directly out front, and the French Quarter to be easy walking distance. Finally, we found the staff to be extremely helpful and accomodating, especially with problems we would encounter later.

We checked in the afternoon on a Friday of a holiday-weekend. Though the lobby was bustling, we made it through in an expedited fashion. We were even greeted by a manager who gave our four-year-old a bunch of beads and made her trip. I should note that we are SPG members, though not even gold or platinum. We were pleasantly surprised when we saw our room on the 27th floor...there was a wonderful view of the river as well. We enjoyed the pool as well, though it did seem a bit small to serve a hotel of this size. High-speed internet was unexpectedly free, despite what the website had said. All good.

That night, however, we were rudely introduced to the biggest problem this hotel presents...paper-thin walls. Around midnight, we were awoken by loud horseplay in the room next to us...a bunch of kids with their yelling, screaming, crying, jumping on beds, and crashing into walls, who had just gotten back to the room. Where were the parents/guardians/chaperones? Out in the hallway yelling at each other, making plans, and having a conversation 100 ft. from each other down the hall. Unreal. Eventually, I had to call down to the desk who promised security would come up and take care of it...well, nothing happened. The block party went on until close to 3am. The next morning, however, we were pleasantly surprised to find a letter from a manager under our door. In it, she apologized for what we went through, gave us a $50 credit, and asked us to come to the front desk. We did so only to receive the dreaded news that our neighbors would be there another night as well. But that was tempered with an offer to move us to an SPG floor, almost certainly to be quieter as it catered more to the business traveler. I suspect we weren't the only ones to complain, as we were also comp'd free parking ($44 per night for four nights!) and were gifted back 10,000 points that we had redeemed for part of our stay. The new room was on the 41st floor, and was just as nice as the first.

At thisoint, let me say the housekeeping was outstanding throughout our stay...our room was done early in the day every day and everything was spotless. All seemed peaches and cream until our last night/morning when we received an unwanted 5am wakeup. Our new neighbor had left his alarm on...it kept chirping through the papier-mache wall until I was finally able to reach someone at the front desk. Security came up and turned the alarm off at 6 am. I tried to go back to sleep, but then the alarm from the other side of the room went off at 0630. Argggh!",0.14514287795537795

Sure you get warm cookies when you check in.  But it doesn't make up for the rude staff.  The musky smell of the rooms. The black mold in the sinks and shower. The water damaged ceilings.  The smelly stained carpet.  This hotel is older but you can tell they did a surface remodel that isn't done well.  The toilet makes a high pitches whistling noise when you flush it that wakes everyone up and the hot and cold handle on the sink are hard to turn on and off.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,3.0,"My boyfriend and I stayed at this hotel for our last night in New Orleans. We both enjoyed our stay, but there were a few things that made me dock a star.

The hotel is in a great location, right at the corner of Canal and Bourbon Street. It's close enough to all of the action but not too close to be extremely noisy. 

Check in was alright - we arrived a bit early and were told our room wasn't ready. Not a big deal - most rooms aren't ready until 3 PM or so anyways. We were able to leave our luggage at Bag Check and went out to explore the city more. Before we left the hotel, the front desk clerk asked for my phone number, and the hotel called me to let me know when our room was ready, which was nice. 

The room was very clean, up on the 7th floor with a decent view of Canal Street. It had everything we needed, including more than enough towels. I always like when hotels provide their guests with adequate towels; it keeps people from having to bug the front desk for more. 

The one thing that bothered me about this hotel: when we came back to the hotel after dinner on Sunday night, we asked someone at the front desk what time check out was. He told us it was at 11 AM. Perfectly fine. We went to bed and I set my alarm to make sure we were up in enough time to get ready and check out by 11 AM.

Around 9 AM, we get a knock on our door from housekeeping asking us if we had already checked out. Ummm...what?? Shouldn't you have a list of which rooms are checking out that day and then make a point not to try to clean those room until after check out time?

Also, we received two phone calls to our room between 9 and 10:30 AM. Both times the person on the other end hung up, which leads me to think that it was the front desk calling to see if we had checked out. It's just very rude to do that in my opinion. I felt as though the hotel wanted us out ASAP, which is ridiculous since I paid for us to be there until 11 AM.

Overall, it was a great stay with a clean room in an awesome location, but I doubt that I'll stay here again if they make such a huge push to get their guests out before it's time to leave.",0.2368852813852814
Four Points by Sheraton Tucson Airport,Tucson,1.0,"Chose this hotel purely due to its proximity to TUC airport. Big mistake, should've stayed at Hampton or Hilton across the street.  This is the first and LAST time for me here...NEVER AGAIN.
First - checked in and got a room# and was told that it's in the west wing, without map it's a scavenger hunt to find Room 117.  Also, at night there are no lights on the grounds near the pool so better bring a flashlight.
Second - didn't rent a car but wanted to go to Tucson Spectrum to catch a movie, but front desk says the hotel shuttle van can only take guest to locations up to 3 miles away...I guess Sheraton don't believe in ""going the extra mile"" to satisfy customer needs.  Well, in this case, it's 2 extra miles, since the Spectrum is 5 miles from the hotel.
Third - walked by a group of hotel staff smoking next the pool, which is adjacent to the restaurant.  What a disgrace to have guests in this high traffic area smell your cigarette puffs.
Fourth - ceiling height inside the hotel walkway is dangerously low. A 6-footer would hit his head on the AC return vents that protrude down from the ceiling...so be prepared to duck or call 911.",0.05761437908496732

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,3.0,"First time in New Orleans, but my trip didn't start off too well because of this hotel. Don't get me wrong it is a beautiful hotel and in a great location but the service is terrible. 

First off, we had to wait in the thirty minute check in line just to find out they had screwed up our accommodations. We had booked two rooms in which the lady at the front desk completely denied and put up a fight about. After showing her proof of purchasing two rooms she finally worked everything out and gave us another room. But what made me really nervous was that the guy next to me was complaining about how after the bellhop had brought his luggage up he was missing three bags!

Even more annoying, the next day we had missed room cleaning so we told them to come back later. We ended up coming home   Later in the day to find the room still not cleaned. Twenty minutes later I was changing into my swimsuit when the cleaning lady just barged into my room!! No knock or announcement just came right in while I was naked! After putting clothes on and confronting her, she had a terrible attitude and yelled at us in a complete unprofessional manor about how we should've had our rooms cleaned earlier like everybody else. She had even left us a rude voicemail on the hotel room telephone about now getting our room cleaned!

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"I was here for Mardi Gras and a conference. The room had an awesome view of the Mississippi River, and you honestly can't beat the location for the price. Walking distance to everything from Bourbon Street, the French Quarter, and Cafe Du Monde!

However, a lot of it was ruined because of the poor service.

On the second day of our visit, our toilet overflowed and started flooding into our room. We called the front desk to report it and it took over an hour for someone to come and address the problem. A kind stranger who had just checked in was the one who came into our room and fixed the toilet for us. Two of my roommates had to move their luggage on to chairs and the desk in order for their belongings to stay dry. Even when an employee did come to address the problem, all they did was throw a few towels on the floor without mopping the bathroom floor or even offering an apology. After a few more hours of having nothing addressed, we went to the front desk in person to complain. We received $100 in hotel credit, which was nice, but honestly it wouldn't have been needed if the hotel just did their job.

A few days later, the battery on our door died so we were unable to use the key card to gain access into our room. The woman at the front desk who answered my roommate's call was extremely rude and unhelpful. Again, it took about an hour or longer for the problem to get fixed.

Holiday Inn Express Philadelphia - Penns Landing,Philadelphia,1.0,"The hotel itself is nice, the rooms are clean, breakfast in the morning was convenient. When I checked in, I was waiting at the desk for almost a minute while Sheday (not sure of the spelling) finished her text message or facebook post on her phone and greeted me as I was interrupting her. I was issued my room and I had to drag my laptop, my luggage and my coat and purse to the 10th floor only to get there and my key didn't work. I came down of course and requested another room away from the ice maker and elevator door. I was then given a room on a floor full of kids which was loud, noisy, and sounded like they were wrestling. Oh and I must mention that this room was also by the elevator. The same room, different floor. I called the front desk and asked for another room due to the noise. The manager Nick at the time told me to stay in my room and he would bring me the key. Of course he took his time coming. When he arrived I asked him what took so long. He then said, ""I thought I was doing YOU a favor by bringing you a key but obviously you don't appreciate it and it appears we just cant make you happy here so you need to gather your things and stay somewhere else"". He continued to tell me he will refund my money to my room because this would be the third time he would move me and he tells me ""you are just that type will never be happy and satisfied so you need to go somewhere else where you would be happy"". Mind you, I was calm and maintained my professionalism. He continued to bully me and threaten to evict me. I told him if I am paying for a room it is my right to request a room change if that room does not meet my expectations and in this case it was noise from the ice maker and elevator, then the noise from the floor full of kids. He continued to persist to refund my money and ""make arrangements for me to go somewhere else"". I was appalled by him treating me this way. I was traveling all day and there on business so I did not want to leave, I just wanted to be comfortable. He was condescending and continued to talk to me disrespectful and overall I felt bullied. I told him I refuse to go back and forth with him and I will escalate this to his manager and I asked who he reports to. He told me ""I'm not giving you that information, you have to look it up yourself"". He then told me ""are you going to take this room or do I need to call you a cab and help you with your bags and send you somewhere else?"" I am not one for conflict so I told him I will take the room. Of course the room was the SAME location again just a different floor near the ice maker, high traffic and the elevator. In requesting a different room I was told there weren't any more of my type of room available and I agreed to take a downgraded room and that I just wanted to be away from the noise of the kids. I never in my LIFE felt so disrespected, bullied, and humiliated while in a vulnerable position because I needed to stay in this hotel. It was obvious he only agreed to bring my key to me to avoid being on the cameras that were at the front desk. I gave this hotel 2 stars because the rooms are actually decent, and when I escalated the situation in the morning the director of sales and the on duty manager Kelly were very accommodating and took the time to listen to me and apologized on Nick's behalf and that made up for how I was backed into a corner by Nick. If a friendly staff is what is important to you in a hotel, I would HIGHLY suggest you not stay here while NICK WILLIAMSOM is still employed here. If he is, If you are not satisfied with your room, you will be made to feel like a burden and an inconvenience by him if you request to change it. And if you request to change it again due to loud noise of other guests (in which him as a manager should have controlled), you will be bullied and humiliated. This guy has no business working in a leadership role in the hospitality industry. 3 times I requested a room away from the elevator and ice maker and EACH time I was moved to a the same rooms ending in ""08"" next to the elevator and ice maker and told there were no other rooms available in which after my due diligence I found out was a lie.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Not a good check in experience at all 30 people in line to check in 3 people working the desk on a holiday is not smart management it took around 45 minute just to check in and wasn't very organized at all they need more staffing and a easier check in cause the system of you can call it that isn't working. And the Parking is outrageously expensive with tax you're looking almost 50 bucks a night and they take forever to get your car as the car is park very far away their are lots better hotels around I'd pass on this one.

Spin checking out the staff is rude very unwelcoming I call down to start the long process it is to get my valet car and they said we cannot have it ready you need to come down here and show your receipt and ticket so then I have to wait to finish getting ready and then wait 30 minutes for them to bring me my car.",0.022267573696145126
Holiday Inn Express Tucson-Airport,Tucson,1.0,"Check in was a nightmare! We were driving in and arriving late and the woman who checked us in kept talking about 3pm checkin when our reservation indicated we would be arriving very late night/wee hours of the morning. My husband selected this motel b/c they claim to be dog friendly. They do not however, feel the need to inform guests of policies regarding dogs. They certainly remembered to add the $20 pet deposit to the bill though.

We have a yorkie that we kenneled when we left to the airport to welcome my stepdaughter home from deployment. The room wasn't attended as a result. My husband mentioned that while we were out our room had not been attended. They sent towels up and promised that the room would be cleaned in the a.m. As we left yesterday morning my husband saw the room attendants in the hall and asked them to clean our room. As we were leaving, my husband took the attritional step of mentioning it (room cleaning) at the front desk. The front desk person then rudely tells us that our dog could not be left 'unattended' in the room. Thanks for the late informations! We then still had to step out to the mall to pick up some things for my stepdaughter's house. We later noticed missed called from Ms. Notsofriendly telling us our dog was barking and that she had 'concerns'. Ummmm....DOGS BARK.

When we returned to the hotel, they had locked us out of our room. We returned to the front desk and asked why. The lady (person who checked us in & never informed us of motel dog policy) said that our dog was a problem b/c she was barking. Sooooooo the solution is to lock people out of rooms as 'punishment'?! I'm looking forward to checkout & to never check into this hell hole ever again.

About the room: It smells stale. Thank God the window opened so we could actually get some fresh air. The room attendants do precious little when 'cleaning'. I suppose they need to conserve their energy for standing in the halls talking. They don't wipe down surfaces and they basically change the towels, 'make up' the bed and roll out. After they 'clean' it certainly doesn't look or smell clean. 

Next time I'll select the hotel. There's an ALOFT nearby.",0.0650224292615597

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"Service: The staff at the desk were so freaking rude. There were two people at the check-in desk yet neither was able to check me in. One was on the computer, another was chatting to someone else. The one chatting asked if I was checking in and told me to wait, then continued chatting. WTF. A few minutes later, he asked me again if I was checking in and went and got someone else to deal with me. He directed me to this other girl who didn't even say ""hi"". I told her I was checking in. She proceeded to do so without even saying a one freakin' word. 

They also managed to screw up my bills. Phone calls and valet parking that I didn't even make or use! After calling the front desk several times and not getting an answer, I had to go down there and get them to sort it out. NOT EVEN A ""SORRY M'AAM"". 

One night I walked in with some to-go food and the guy at the desk was joking that he had ordered his food ages ago and was wondering where it was at. I have a sense of humour but I feel this was rather racist even. Would you say that to a Caucasian male or female? NO.  

Room: The room was ok. The beds were comfy but the carpet was old (chewing gum matted into the carpet), the shower curtain in the bathroom stank of mould and the tissues were WET. 

Location: Location was central and good for venturing around the French Quarter and CBD. 

How this place gets a 4 diamond AAA rating, I don't know. I have stayed at Crowne Plaza's other hotels many times before but the standard of this one was very below par.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Horrified to have to jam a towel under my 9th floor Hotel room door at the ASTOR CROWN PLAZA, New Orleans that is costing me over $1,200 + tax for my 6 night stay, because a nasty mouse just ran across my room. 

The towel is because once I tried to corral the mouse, it ran & squeezed itself out through the gap under door. The hotels pitiful response was ""oh no sorry, do you need someone to come up"" in a call that clearly showed there was no real concern because she said there were no rooms available and she would let maintenance know...in the morning. 

A 2nd call 20 minutes later advising them just how upsetting it is to have no response & to see a rodent in my room just before going to sleep, led to only a simple ""OK"" when I said I had to jam a towel under the door, so I got upset about that complete lack of concern & I said ""is that all you are going to say"", did she offer to switch my room. ...NO! As a matter of fact the reaction was rude because it seemed I was bothering them to do something they were going to do nothing about. 

That lack of concern & attention to customer service is as HORRIFIC as finding a mouse in your supposed high end hotel room!!

UPDATE: As per the Hotel General Manager,  the front desk staff failed to notify the manager on duty or even note that there was any issue at all. 2 days after having the mouse in my room, when signing in to the hotel Wi-Fi at night, I was prompted to review the service & my satisfaction. I stated I was not satisfied & why & was contacted first thing the next morning by the General Manager who was appalled at the fact no one reported or did anything to remedy the situation.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"We were disappointed with this hotel from the minute we arrived until the minute we left. Valet was the biggest problem (granted they didn't end up charging me for valet). They were rude and unhelpful when we arrived and sat out front for 30 minutes waiting for them. They ended up telling me to turn my car off and leave it in the street for them to get later. The next day when we needed our car back I texted them 20 minutes in advance, as instructed, to which they replied ""there is an issue with your ticket please bring it to the booth"" which I did, and I asked the attendant what the ""issue"" was and he told me ""the only issue was that they're busy and didn't want to get my car at that time"". Their valet is not cheap either. Would have been $47 after tax (plus tip) if I had paid for it. Beds were very hard. The shower curtain was about 1 foot shorter than the shower, so there wasn't a way to comfortably shower. They don't even have normal hotel toiletries, they have bottles of shampoo and conditioner that you share with previous guests. All in all I didn't feel this hotel should be listed as a 4-star hotel.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"On Friday 27, 2017 at 1 PM I attempted to check into our hotel the Crown Plaza Astor. We were not greeted by any employees at the hotel. A woman, named Keisha, was the only person working at the front desk. She did not look up when we approached the desk and when she did finally look up she said ""yes?"" And we had to tell her, ""hi we would like to check in."" She appeared surprised and annoyed. We attempted to check in but we were told the rooms would not be ready until the latest 4:00. She told us we would receive a text message when the room was ready. We knew we were early for check in so this didn't come as a surprise. After never receiving a text, we returned to the hotel after 4:00 and waited in a line of approximately 20 people. None of us waiting were told that the computer system was down while waiting in this line. As I waited, my friend went to retrieve our bags and tip the bellman. We then approached the same hospitality worker, Keisha, and we were told that the system was down she then asked how many beds we requested in the room. We told her that we had booked and already paid for a city view room with two beds. She then responded that because we wanted double beds the computer system will not allow her to see if the room was ready. I then asked how someone who had just cut the line had received keys to her room and we would not be able to receive ours. Keisha then said, ""that's why I asked you if you need two double beds and you told me that you did need double beds; that woman received keys because she only had one bed in her room and if you could just wait here more patiently I promise I will make it worth your while"". (I was not impatient at all and I returned after 4:00 when she said at the latest the room would be ready.) I then asked if she had an anticipated wait time for the room to which she responded, ""wait at least 45 minutes"". When we asked if we would have to stand in the line after the 45 minutes to get our key she said ""probably"" and shrugged her shoulders. We told Keisha that we would wait at the bar so we wheeled all of our luggage to the bar and sat for over an hour and a half spending $40. After 45 minutes we did indeed check back at the counter and we were told that the system was still down. After another 40 or so minutes I walked back up to the counter and Keisha was typing on her computer and did not look up at me. Without looking up at me she said, ""I sent you a text 30 minutes ago"". I then said that I never received a text message and I showed her my phone, with my list of texts and she did not look up. She said, ""well I texted you over 30 minutes ago"". She said nothing and walked away from me returning with two keys and handed them to me without saying a word. Because I didn't know the room was ready I wasn't able to tell her that I did need four room keys. At that time I did tell her and she walked away silently returned with two more keys and handed them to me. I then said, ""is that it""? She then said, ""mhmm"" never looking up at me. 

At no point did a manager appear, address the line or the issue. My friends and I have worked in multiple service-line industry jobs so we completely understand that glitches occur and computer systems fail. However, Kiesha was the face of the hotel throughout the entire time. Not only was she unbelievably rude PRIOR to the system crashing, but she never stated the phrases ""thank you for your patience"" or ""sorry for the inconvenience"".

I wanted to write you this email because initially I was upset about her initial interaction or lack there of, but now I feel that it is imperative that a manager reads and responds. 

I understand it is neither Keisha's fault nor the staff's fault that the computer system was down but this entire situation was handled poorly. 

Our first few hours of New Orleans were not the way we planned. We VERY patiently waited for the system failure to return after Keisha promised us that she would ""make it worth our while"". Still not sure what she meant by that....",0.032052001496445964

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,2.0,"Stayed here since I had an early flight out in the morning. I didn't rent a car so I dealt with taking the train to the airport and then their airport shuttle to get here the evening before. It all worked out great. Tried out their restaurant and had a Philly Cheese steak and also a side of  asparagus (which I loved!). Weird situation occurred when I had to pay. He asked for cash or otherwise he'd have to take my credit card to the main lobby area for me to pay. I opted for the latter, but really? Apparently he said they got hacked recently, but still, sounds a bit odd. There was only one other person there in the restaurant when I was there, and she came in after I did. Guess I should have figured out with no one in there, before I sat down, that perhaps I should have gone somewhere else to eat.

I was hoping to take a quick swim in the pool but it was full of families and other folks so I ended up passing this time around.

The management is incompetent save one factor...they completely back up their staff, even when they are wrong and in need of the kind of leadership and training you would expect a manager to provide. Now to add insult to injury throw in the SPG corporate customer service. Equally incompetent and unable to help. They'll ""open a case"" and then immediately close it.

We reserved our room through BookIt.com, which may have been our first mistake.  It doesn't seem like they're a full service travel agency, as they were unable or unwilling to help us when we had a problem.  We picked the 4-star 4-diamond Mystery Hotel, and pretty sure those ratings are from the early 80s.  We arrived to a not-so-clean room, and a ton of noise.  There's numerous carpet stains, and what looks to be chips in the porcelain (or plastic more likely) of the tub, and a few disconcerting stains in the tub as well.  The walls in this place are very thin, so you can easily hear your neighbors' conversations and every time they use the sink/toilet/shower.  The hotel is also on the corner of Bourbon Street, so you get to listen to the music blasting from some of the clubs all night too.  We had originally asked for a king sized bed on a higher floor, but got two queens on a low floor.  When I brought this up with the front desk, they didn't seem to care, and essentially left me with ""the hotel is on Bourbon Street, so what did you expect?""  Well, I expected my requests to be at least considered, the staff to be helpful, and my room to be neat and tidy.  As for the noise, maybe you should install double paned glass or more insulation so guests don't hear everything going on next door and 5 floors below.  At the very least, clearly state on your website and any place you advertise that it's a noisy property.  To top it all off, the showers seem to be pumping out maybe a gallon an hour, so you're left with a trickle of soft water.  Have fun trying to get shampoo and soap off with that. I don't know if the soft water is a New Orleans thing, but from my experience at some of the bars and restaurants, it seems to be just a Crowne Plaza thing.  So stop pumping water softener into your water, and dial up your pressure while you're at it.  

Lesson learned: don't stay on Bourbon street, and remember that Crowne Plaza hotels don't seem to have received updates in a few decades.  Go with a boutique hotel (some in the area looked very cool) or one of the bigger brands that has a little more cache (and deeper pockets to keep their properties up to date).

Holiday Inn Express Tucson-Airport,Tucson,2.0,"First: My family has Gold Member status with IHG, so we have stayed in a multitude of different Holiday Inns. For this specific stay, we had been traveling for 10 hours and were ready to relax before traveling more. 

This Holiday Inn Express, which is right near the airport, is the worst we have ever experienced. 

The good:
Plenty of parking, a ceiling fan in the room (big plus, air circulation was great), first floor for easy access, HBO in the room, a very nice TV, refrigerator and microwave were very clean, and the temperature could be controlled by a wall thermostat instead of the usual wall unit under the window. 

The not so good:

Service was good but the hostess was grouchy when we first arrived. She wasn't rude, but maybe had just had a rough day. Not a big deal, would have never thought twice about it.

Unfortunately, it only got worse from there. Something (I'm assuming an air conditioning vent that I observed from the wall in the hall) was taped just inside the door above the sink vanity with hot pink duct tape. 

The walls next to the first bed looked like someone had rubbed dirt all over the lower section of the wall. There were brown and black marks everywhere. 

The bed sheets were not only made poorly, but were also stained. Both the fitted sheet and the comforter had brown spots and smears on them. We had to go to the front desk and get another sheet to replace the original before we could go to sleep. The bed skirts were also stained.

The wall underneath the shower head was covered in soap scum. Had this been a permanent stain from the water, I would have understood. However, after a quick wipe with a wet napkin, it came right off. Clearly it just hadn't been cleaned. 

Also, during a movie we were watching on the tv right before sleeping, (not PPV, just on cable) the service cut out. While they surely cannot be blamed for this, it definitely did not help the experience.

Choose wisely. We will most likely not stay at this location again.",0.17086243386243388

Atmosphere was A+, clean everything no even a smudge in the restrooms but the people catering and bartending our event we're too much. Peaking around corners and out windows looking at us like we were going to rob the place. Pretty disrespectful. I want to say it wasn't obvious but we all took notice.

We were there for my sisters bachelorette party and we had to have the lingerie shower in a room that was pretty much the size of my closet. Not. Cool. We requested double beds month or so in advance we didn't get that nor could they give them to us; first come, first serve basis. They're we're a few people at the front desk that were just plain rude. Oh! And bc mardi gras weekend was about to kick off they made us park our car in a garage 2 and half blocks away so then we had to get a bellboy to push all of our luggage through the crowded streets of New Orleans.

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"Stayed here for 3 nights 2 weeks ago. The hotel was in a good location and the valet/bell men were very nice. Some of the ladies (well, one in particular) at the front desk could use some customer service training. I enjoyed my stay at the Sheraton with the exception of the following...I arrived on Thursday. By Friday night I noticed 3 bites on my right calf. Didn't pay much attention to it. On Sunday I showed by friend and she said ""OMG, those are bed bug bites"". I've never seen bed bug bites before so I didn't know. I reported it to the manager so they could check the room out just in case it was bed bugs. She was nice and said they would call Orkin and contact me in a week with their findings. Haven't heard anything yet . After I talked to the manager, the security person came to take pictures of my leg and to take my report. I told him that I first noticed the bumps Friday night. He said ""So, you noticed the bumps on Friday but you're just saying something on Sunday"". I really didn't appreciate that comment. 
Second, I noticed a stain on the bed skirt. Looked like someone spilled BBQ sauce on it. It was a big stain. I noticed it my 2nd day. I didn't say anything because I was in and out of the room so much, I would just forget about it. my concern is that housekeeping cleaned our room everyday. And she never took it upon herself to change the bed skirt?? 
Last, we needed to print our Saints tickets for the game. Only one printer was working in the lobby and someone was using the working computer that was attached to that printer. (The other computer wasn't working). We went to the front desk to see if they could print for us. The rude front desk worker said ""Go to the business center"". So we went to the business center and realized that it costs to not only use the computer but to also print. Why would we pay when it's free in the lobby? Luckily, the manager once again came to our aid. She let us email her the attachment and she printed the tickets for us. I can't remember her name but I think it was Kristin. She was really nice and helpful. 
Overall, I say this hotel is ok. The view from the room was nice and the location is really good. The bed was comfortable and most of the staff was friendly. I just wish I knew the outcome of the bed bug investigation. I'm sure other people have stayed in that room since I left. I just hope the situation wasn't bed bugs for their sake.",0.2125918367346939

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Unfortunately, my stay at the Astor crowne plaza was not at all what I would expect from a Crown Plaza hotel. First off, we reserved 4 rooms and called numerous times to confirm that they would be by each other and two and two would be connected. The morning of our stay we called to confirm one last time and were informed they would be. When we arrived, which leads me to my next compliant, check in was at 3; however, our rooms were not ready until 6. The the rooms were not connected and only 2 were next to each other, yet still not connected. This was very frustrating for a lot of reasons. We were there for a bachelorette party and couldn't stay near each other as requested and promised and not being able to check in until 6 made us late for firm dinner reservations. Secondly, housekeeping did not provide clean towels or replenish the toilet paper in one of the rooms. I called to request some and it never came. We had to call a second time later in the day for it be brought several minutes later. Lastly, the biggest complaint I have, on the last night of our stay, we woke up at 3 am to 2"" of water in our bathroom and front hallway, even out our door. We went to the front desk to notify them and all they could offer was for us to move rooms. It was 3am, the bride was sleeping, stuff was everywhere, no one in their right mind would move rooms at 3am, yet this was the only thing they could offer. They sent a gentleman up to vacuum who was very inconsiderate, rude, and seemed extremely bothered to help us. He, along with the front desk staff, interrogated us and tried to blame us for this incident. Based on the horrific smell and the fact we were asleep and previous draining issues with the sink, it was clearly sewage water and an issue with the pipes and/or toilet in the bathroom. This resulted in ruined clothes, personal items, and a suitcase. We informed the staff again the next more and they finally agreed to comping at least one night. Overall, for everything we went through, I do not feel as though this was enough nor appropriately handled. 

Oh and the beds are really hard.

On a positive note, the breakfast downstairs was bomb.",-0.03312347073216638

The room was pretty dirty when coming in, air conditioning didn't work, and WiFi and TV were having issues. We made our complaint and tried being nice seeing if they could clean it asap. The toilet paper rolls were not replaced from last people, so there was barely any. Since they left it empty, I called to have some refilled and they were very rude hanging up on me saying ""yeahh."" They clearly can not hire educated people, since they can not speak or act like a hospitol person. They should leave their job and work at McDonalds, which may be speaking too highly for Danielle and Sherita.... The front door had wine and something else spilled all over it....hopefully not throw up. Pillow cases had stains on it as well as handprint smudges on the back of the bathroom door. It's gross.

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,2.0,"I've been going here with my family for probably 15 years and was so incredibly disappointed on my last visit. It's always beautiful but that only goes so far. I myself work in the service/hospitality industry so I understand frustration with obnoxious guests but my GOD- the service was HORRIBLE. I've never experienced such terrible service. The bartenders and servers by the pool were not attentive in any way, were not even nice or smiling when greeting us and we're the slowest moving people ever. It wasn't even busy when we were out there so there was no real excuse. They were so rude and just seemed like they could care less about our business. Also, the bartender up in the lobby was so incredibly rude to our group. We were there for a wedding and I'm sure 25 of us showing up at the bar was overwhelming but I've never had someone be so incredibly dismissive and rude. I mean he could have probably made an extra 50 bucks off of us (we tip very well) but he refused to be hospitable at all. One night I could tell that he was specifically ignoring me and avoiding eye contact with me and it was honestly WEIRD. I've just never experienced that. It was honestly like none of them wanted us there. I understand that a big group of people drinking can get a little rowdy but they just seemed like they sincerely hated us. I honestly don't know if I will ever go back. I never EVER yelp or review places but I was so shocked and frustrated with my experience that I seriously couldn't help but say something.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"I stayed here during a conference, not as a tourist. I was blocked from entering the hotel by a man mopping the floor paying no attention to anything. I had to wait until he finished. No apology, no accommodation. I got to the Reception desk where the attendant acknowledged me. However, I couldn't get to the couter because someone was mopping something off the floor which was stuck. She didn't acknowledge me and the attendant look at me like I was holder her up by waiting until I didn't have to step over a mop bucket. I got the room and all was well until I discovered that there was no toilet tissue to be found. I looked around for a brochure or pamphlet about hotel services such as where to get breakfast, location of vending and the like. Nothing to be found. Asked staff where vending was and was told second floor - it's on the 3rd. I couldn't place anything in the drawers provided since they smelled like insecticide or mothballs or something. I placed a few items in there initially thinking the smell was temporary, only to discover that my person items picked up the smell. I removed everything from the drawers and the smell disappeared by morning.

I looked for a place to pick up a bottle of water, but there is nothing in the hotel. I walked out to find a place and had to dodge the vagrants and urine smell - this was daytime. I walked across Bourbon street to a Walgreens where they were rude and THAT store smelled of urine.  I noticed during my stay that they wash down the sidewalk in the morning... Thank goodness!

They were very kind about this and waived the resort fee and offered us a complimentary welcome drink from the bar. When we finally did enter our room, it was upgraded and clean. 
We took advantage of the Platinum complimentary continental breakfast. Beware that the hot foods are NOT included in this and you will be charged the $21.95 price for the breakfast buffet. Not the biggest deal, but good to know. The continental breakfast includes cereal, yogurt (or cottage cheese) fruit, coffee/tea and pastries. On the weekends they serve this buffet style, though during the week they will being a selection to your table (way better imo). 
The pools are expansive and the fitness center is well stocked (once you find it!). I wish they had more to do here - bikes to rent would be great, or maybe a trail that leads to hiking. There are tennis courts and raquetball onsite but they are an additional fee. Their grounds include a membership only area where the fitness center, raquetball, and tennis courts are located.

I had to call five times before someone picked up the phone and there was no voice mail in place. I waited 35+ minutes for the pick up!

On day two, we also were greeted by the hostess at breakfast, but not by a waitress until we had finished our meals. 

On the final day, I brought the wrong charges to the attention of the front desk, and the clerk there was not exactly rude, but sort of acted like we were inconveniencing her by having to take the extra charge off of our bill. I explained the issue, and she said nothing, just took the bill and disappeared into the back room for a few minutes.

I booked this hotel because they offered 10am check in which became completely pointless. When making the reservation I spoke with the woman in the reservation department who I informed that my gf would be there before me so she had her name added on the reservation on my credit card. When she arrived at 10am the front desk would not allow her in the room bc she did not have my card in her possession.  Once my gf informed me I called the reservation department who was confused as to why she could not get the room as well after they ensured my card was on file and the room was reserved. The woman put me on hold for 15 minutes while she tried to locate the manager, once she got back to the phone she informed me that the manager would have to call me back bc she was busy.

In order to speak to the manager i had to call my gf and have her go to the front desk and request the ""manager"". I was then put in touch with a rude and hostile woman telling me she didn't have my card on file, which was bs since the reservation department stated opposite. After threatening to use another hotel for my weekend stay the situation was resolved by me having to email this woman the last 4 of my credit card, which makes zero sense since you cant run the card off just 4 digits.

I stayed here this past week and I don't think I'll be returning, sadly. I got into my room that was very accommodating, as usual. Upon closer examination, however, I found a pubic hair (yes, really, a pubic hair) in the tub and the ice bucket that was supplied had a little yellow (?) crud on the inside. During the night my neighbor was very loud, and kept slamming their door hard throughout the night. I called the front desk three times to resolve the issue, and the young lady that answered said she would send security up to take care it. Well, it was never resolved. The slamming of the front door continued until 3:30 am, so needless to say, I hardly got any sleep that night. Now I don't blame the hotel for a rude person slamming their door because people should know manners, but I had to call three times. Three times? I have to also add that even after the third complaint to the front desk that the person next door to me continued to slam their door and just be loud and obnoxious. Really?

The icing on my horrible stay was the morning I left. Both elevators were out of service so I had to take the stairs down to the lobby.

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,3.0,"This resort is not a place to go and relax. This is a resort to dump the kids off at the pool all day while you drink at the crappy poolside bar.

Here are the issues I had with this place:

1. The pool area is very nice and the waterslide is a plus, but the pool area is also very dangerous and dirty. The bricks around the pool are all loose and covered in gravel so if you walk around between pools your feet will be injured. The waterslide stairs are in need of repair and one of the hot tubs was out of service.
2. The staff are clueless about the daily events they host. They have a sign by the pool that lists all of the events during the day but if you ask one of the employees by the pool they will basically tell you they have no idea. Totally unacceptable. I had to ask for a manager inside just to find out where they were hosting the movies and smores event.
3. The rooms are very noisy. I could hear people running up and down the halls and I could hear the people next-door waking up and showering at 4 AM. Not restful at all!
4. The beds and pillows are atrociously uncomfortable. Their ""heavenly bed"" is as stiff as a brick and the pillows are as flat as a pancake. I could not get a good night's rest at all during my stay between the noise and the bed.
5. The staff at the poolside grill are rude. I ordered a turkey burger and the menu says it comes with fruit, but what arrived were fries. I told the staff and he basically wanted me to just deal with the fries, so I was forced to get pissy with him so he would bring me fruit. Then when he came back with the fruit he made a disrespectful comment towards me. He needs a good slap in the face and to be fired. The only acceptable response to my situation should have been ""sorry, let me go grab you some fruit.""

Oh there is nothing so pleasant at the end of a long day of meetings as to walk into an unserviced room not once but twice!  Yes two days in a row. Then on the second day, after complaining, to have housekeeping deliver towels and find them place on the vanity without picking up the used towels and putting the new towels where they should have been. Next day my fiancé was unable to access the room because the room key wouldn't work.  She was treated badly and was told she couldn't be let into the room because her name was not on the reservation. But they didn't ask her name when they issued two keys!  So now it's our problem. I was in meetings and had to leave to deal with this.  When I called the receptionist told me the manager could not take my call because she was busy checking in guests. She did so with quite an attitude. Admittedly mine was worsening rapidly.  I finally got to speak with the manager. She was not pleased to take my call judging by the attitude once again.  Not good.

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,Service here is horrible. We checked in today and have had nothing but a bad experience. Valet/doorman are clueless and so unhelpful. Woman working the front desk was clueless and rude. So dissatisfied.,-0.6666666666666666
Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,3.0,"Before I begin, I want to thank Kai (Kie) who served us at check in. She was very friendly and tended to our needs. She even went as far to make sure our rooms were to our liking. She was gracious and handled any issues we had. Next a huge thank you to Georgette from housekeeping. This woman was courteous and cleaned the hell out of my room. And I can be messy when on vacation. The rest of the staff was amazing as well. 

I would recommend staying at the Astor Crowne Plaza but the are somethings you must know before deciding on staying in this sweet spot off Canal and Bourbon.  The wireless is non-existent. I stayed for 6 days and was never able to get connected. When I called about it (Day 1) I was told the engineer was working on it and to call back in an hour. When I called back the front desk lady was rude and didn't seem to be concerned about my issue. I want to say her name was Brianna. Needless to say, I never got a call back nor did the internet work...EVER. So if you require internet for whatever reason, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. Though on vacation, I was unable to keep in touch with work responsibilities and killed the data on my plan due to this problem. 

Next, on my last day my door key stopped working for no reason at all. They wanted to say I did it, but honestly my two friends had the same issue right before me. My issue here was the front desk wanted me to wait in a long line of people checking in. After asking for the manager, he was kind enough to take care of me and get me a new key. 

Other pluses:
1. Nice gym facilities
2. Convenient to Bourbon Street
3. Nice beds/pillows
4. Television channels with premium channels (Was able to watch the Game of Thrones marathon

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"I'm writing this review based not on a stay here but the valet out front. Let me just say wooooow!!!! My sister was staying here so I would go pick her family up here and drop them off every day and would pull right up in front of the valet. I had my windows rolled down on this particular day as it was april(yeah I'm a little late on the review), anyways there were 3 valets out front. One was actually doing his job while the other two(one of which was some sort of head valet) were talking about the night before. Very descriptive and graphic details of a sexual encounter. I'm no prude but the profanity was actually bothering me bc it was so over the top.  And if I can hear your loud ass while being parked on canal then clearly your volume was too loud. And then it didn't stop after his made up story was over, he turns his attention to the females walking down the street. He had no filter and made sure to comment on pretty much everyone walking by. He used every curse word including ones describing female genatalia and his own which made me wanna puke. And he wasnt using medical terminology if you know what i mean. He made facial expressions behind people's backs. One woman walked by and he looked her up and down and made the disgusted look and then shook his body off like he was trying to shake the image. He caught me looking at him and he just laughed. The most unprofessional disgusting pig I've ever encountered at any business in my entire life! I urged my sis to complain but she wouldn't so now it's on yelp. Hope he gets fired for being a creepy perv!!!!",-0.0027901785714285754

The happy hours and breakfasts they host for club members on the 42nd floor are actually really amazing! I would have given our 5 day stay a 5 star rating, except the morning bar staff at the circle bar was really rude and acted like I was putting them out by ordering a drink.

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,I am currently staying at this hotel and I just say I would have rather stayed at a Red Roof inn!  They offer valet parking but they only have one attendant working for two different hotels! The wait to drop off and pick up your car is ridiculous. We waited for 10 mins to drop off the car and still no valet attendant! So I decided to get out of the car and go to the front desk to see where the attendant was and there was two clerks and the front desk and there was one couple in front of me checking in with one clerk and the other clerk was tending to something else but not a guest! I was patiently waiting to speak to one of the clerks when another guest comes up and then the clerk that was tending to something else and not a guest greeted the lady and start assisting her even though I was there before her! When I saw that I felt completely ignored! So I started to walk out the door back to my car but as soon as I started to walk away the clerk asked was there something I could help with! I kept walking cause it should not have took for me to walk away for them to acknowledge my presence! I just my husband in to speak with them cause I was extremely upset and by that time the valet attendant finally came. He stated that if there wasn't anyone one outside than we should go inside and ask for them to send valet out! NEVER have I ever had to do that with valet that! The worst valet service and customer service I have had at a hotel! I will NEVER be coming back to this hotel and I would never be suggesting this hotel to anyone! Shouldn't have even had to pay for valet parking! Giving one star cause I have to in order to leave review other wise it would be zero!,0.0037554824561403534
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,1.0,"I'll NEVER stay here again!  We were here for 5 days total (4 work 1 play).  The front desk guy was less than friendly.  He acted like we were waisting his time, asking for a king room when it was just me and my husband & we had booked a king.  He gave us a room on the 9th floor with a view of a metal roof vent and little square windows over the pool.  (Possibly the last king room, even though he didn't state that, but I doubt it.)  

The server at the Pelican Bar, Courtney, was just as rude.  All three times we were there, she acted as though it was an inconvenience for her to have to serve us.   

At breakfast on the 2nd floor, our first experience was pleasant!  The server was friendly and attentive.  The next morning, our server was at our table twice.  Once to take our order and then to drop the bill.  I couldn't get a diet coke refill (in my glass full of ice) to save my life.  I asked an attendant if I could please have a refill and he said ""as soon as I'm done"".  He was attending tables that were not set up....when there were AT LEAST 12 other tables (yes, I counted because at this point I was fed up with holier than thou service) that were already empty and set up.  I've never been at a restaurant where they were more concerned with setting up tables in a room full of already set tables, rather than helping customers currently in house.

There wasn't a microwave or mini refrigerator (I didn't see any other rooms) and the bathroom was SOOOO SMALL.  Every time I opened the bathroom door, it hit the wall.

The upside would be the bed.  It was SUPER comfortable and we did sleep well.  The location is good for the French Quarter and trolly's.  But there are MANY other hotels in the area as well.

My husband and I are very friendly!  I worked in the hotel industry for 15 years before I had children, and when you're paying the prices you do for this ""type"" of hotel, I expect to receive far better SERVICE than we did.",0.16188151041666665
Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Airport,Indianapolis,1.0,"This hotel sucks. Stayed here for Super Bowl XLVI. Handicap room too small, They put coffee maker next to toilet (gross), no room for roll A way bed, so my son, husband & I had to share king bed. Bathroom not  accessible & the door locked up.  Had to have maintenance up to unlock door.  CP employee claimed he worked at another location & at his location they had keys to unlock the bathroom & any interior doors.  My husband had to eventually unlock the door with tools provided by the CP employee because the CP employee was unable to unlock the door.  Elevator constantly broke down, my son is in a wheelchair, we were on the 5th floor so this was stressful.  Food & buffet in dining room cold & gross, but somehow room service food OK. Both use same kitchen...oh & ice machines were slimy with mold. When we made basic inquiries about hotel services, most of the staff claimed that this branch was not the one they usually worked at, so they didn't know anything. Front desk staff pleasant, MOD Chris, super, bar staff great especially SALLY. However when I found a charge for $472.79 on my credit card even the accounting department, Bryan, could not explain what it was for. General Manager Mark Pogonis was rude & hung up on me during our conversation, & refused to take my calls when I called back. It was not a SUPER STAY.

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,4.0,I was in New Orleans for The Essence Festival and had a grrrrreat time. Sheraton  check in was easy and check out was just as easy. Its in a perfect spot on Canal street and great proximity to everything!!! We walked just about everywhere. The trolley car stop is literally across the street. The rooms were clean had a gorgeous view of the river..loved the elevator you put in your room number on the outside panel and those are the only rooms it goes to no adding when you get on loved it. The bathroom was small like an apt size but who cares lol I cant comment on room service or anything like that because I didnt use it. however I did ask for more coffee and they brought it pretty fast for me to be on the 23rd floor. I refused service and they called to make sure I did and let me know I could change my mond at any time with no questions. Just a tip valet is $42/day and there is no other option. There is a bar abd starbucks located right on the premises for all you buckys is  that what youre called?? Anyway New Orleans and the Sheraton will see me again Baaby.,0.3927137445887446

Beyond noisy. When the person next door opened their door I thought someone was coming in our room. Rude, inconsiderate people traipsing on the walkway at all hours talking so loudly it sounded as though they were using a bullhorn. Very difficult access from parking lot to room.

Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Downtown/Convention Center,New Orleans,4.0,"We checked in to this hotel yesterday for an overnight stay before leaving on our cruise. Initially checking in, everyone was friendly, but I did get a little irritated when our room wasn't ready and they were going to leave our luggage on a cart sitting around the corner from reception. Now I don't mind that the room wasn't ready, because we were a little early, but where they wanted to leave our luggage, there was a huge brick wall, which you will see in the pictures. There was no way that they could watch our luggage. For one, they were busy and people were everywhere and for another, the elevators were off to the side where our luggage was going to be stored. Anyone could come off the elevator, grab something and get back on the elevator. For a hotel this size, I figured they'd be like Pechanga and have a luggage storage room for guests when their rooms aren't ready. Connie, our hotel representative really tried to reassure us that nothing would happen to our stuff because there are cameras. I kindly explained to her that criminal justice is my field and I know what I'm talking about. I told her that I'm not trying to be rude, but simply trying to explain to her what could happen. She then kind of rolled her eyes and walked away as I was still talking. This pissed me off and was unnecessary, since I was trying to be nice, but whatever...I know what the hell I'm talking about.  Clearly, protecting and serving is not her forté, just like running a hotel isn't mine.  My sister alone has expensive Louis Vuitton Monogrammed luggage that someone could take, let alone take it for what they think might be in it. The point is, you should have a storage area for ALL luggage if people can't check in to their rooms. I hope they didn't expect us to wheel our luggage down the French Quarter while we wait for our rooms! Anywho, I wasn't mad at Connie, I just needed her to understand that you can't guarantee anyone of such a thing when you're not really watching it. She finally told us that they have an area in back and got help from Joe, the valet who graciously pushed our cart to the back, where they stored everything until our room was ready. 

We went to lunch and came back. Connie helped us again. She was overall really nice. I have no complaints about her. She offered us the option of two different rooms and we chose one facing the street. The room itself was very comfortable. It was also larger than we expected and they had adjoining doors on both walls for the next rooms, in case you have a large group that you're checking in with. 

They have a guest laundry room, which I thought was great, especially given that you're in New Orleans...lots of people mess up their clothes puking and pooping (no kidding) while out partying! They also have a really nice gym, with a great view of the pool and courtyard.",0.09714097322430655

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"My wife and I stayed here Saturday, Dec 21, 2013. I booked it several weeks in advance. On the night of our arrival, our flight had been delayed so we arrived very late, around 3AM. We needed to get to our room ASAP and get some sleep since we had to be up very early the next day for a 12 hour drive with multiple stops to see family.

When we arrived, the lady at the front desk informed us that we were ""unable"" to be checked in at that time. I asked what that meant, and she said that their computers had to be ""backed up"" every night, and during that time no guests could be checked into the hotel. I asked how long we'd have to wait and she said 30-45 minutes. I asked what we should do in the mean time and she said we could wait in the lobby. I told her that I need to be up in a few hours and is there anything she could do to get us into a room faster. She said no, and that she'd let me know when the 30-45 minutes were up and she could check us in.

I want to note here that she was very cordial about the situation; not rude, but not apologetic. I think her name was Flora, but I can't remember for sure.

Around 3:45AM, she came out from a back room and told us that the computers were back up, but that she couldn't print a key card for some reason. She said she'd walk us to our room, let us in, and slide the card under the door later. Once we were in our room, I had a very hard time getting the door closed and deadbolted. For some reason it wanted to stay ajar.

The next morning when we checked out, a different young lady at the desk told us that we could use our hotel key card to swipe out of the parking deck. However, this did not work, and we ended up in that embarrassing situation where you have five cars piled up behind you while you keep swiping your card into the machine over and over. I eventually bit the bullet and swapped for my credit card and paid the $30 parking fee.

Ultimately, I feel that the lady who checked us in should have been prepared for that type of situation, or at least thought of a solution to accommodate us somehow. My recommendation is that at the beginning of the day, print out a list of expected arrivals (many hotels do this already), and if a customer arrives while the computer is down - as unlikely of a situation as that may seem - then check to see what room they have booked, take an imprint of their credit card onto carbon paper, hold their driver's license until the next morning, and walk them up to their room.",-0.060240740740740754

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,4.0,"Wish I would be able to give this place a 5 star review but there were a couple of discrepancies. 1. My room was not turned and as I went to the front guest and informed them about this, they attempted to turn it around on me and say that I possibly opted for the 'go green' program which means that house keeping service will not be offered. I am here on a business trip for 3 days and was not even told about this program, therefore, how was I supposed to opt to be in this program. However, the gentleman did apologize numerous times and by the time I went back to my room later on that day, it was turned over. 2. My boss and I went to the hotel bar and went to order drinks and I asked the bartender (Cleide) a simple question and that was, ""why does New Orleans not have any lemonade?"" She rudely responded with, ""I don't know, maybe you should get accustomed to New Orleans drinks."" Some may not find this rude but the tone that she carried with this remark pretty much said that she didn't care to be involved in a conversation with her guest and seemed like she didn't care for a person from out of town. Even with this poor attitude given from this employee, I thanked her and walked away without her saying or even acknowledging me. Aside from these, I would like to say that this Sheraton is amazing.

To start I Reserved and confirmed a double bedroom asked for my gold card upgrade and she said we don't do that here?? even told the front desk clerk when checking in again. I got to my room It was A king. Returned to the front desk she said sorry I did hear you say it was a double etc etc. and gave me my new room, I walked in it was muggy stale air it was the late night I turned the air on full. and almost nothing it had to be mid 80,s. could barely sleep. In the am I went to the front desk and asked please have the a/c repaired. she said right away. I returned to the room 5 hours later and it was 90 degrees in there and the air would not turn on i called the manager and she said let's just move you. After unpacking 8 days worth of clothes e etc I moved rooms to a very cold room but the carpets looked like they had some serious stains and big wrinkles in them. The Bellman which was very nice said OMG let me change your room again1! I said no its nice and cold I will stay just have them clean the carpets when I leave in the am. That night my son arrived and all night long the new rooms a/c kept turning off and making a very loud bang. Night 2 could not sleep. Again I called the mgr this time I got the voicemail. The front desk said they would take care of it. I returned that night nothing was taken care of and no returned call.!! The next day tried to call the mgr the operator was the rudest operator ever in any hotel and hung up on my 2 times, the mgr said they would bypass the thermostat so it would not turn off and said he would give me a small credit... I told him I wasn't looking for a credit I was looking for a Marriot quality Hotel room!! this was the most worn out nasty old Marriot hotel rooms I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even the room service was not up to standards. we ordered 2 burgers 2 glasses of water and 2 shrimp cocktails they brought 1 burger. And then after 30 more min, we were charged delivery fees plus this that... Some of the staff was very professional and nice like the bellman. But I am taking this complaint farther to Corporate. I could write one more page of bad issues during my stay but I think this is enough.

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"I'm loyal Marriott. My entire family is loyal to Marriott. However, this was my first disappointing experience at a Marriott Hotel. 

The valet and luggage folks were excellent. However, during check-in, only one of our 2 rooms was ready. We were told that we would be called shortly in order to let us know that the other room was available. 4 hours later, still no call. We paid the front desk a visit and of course, our original concierge lady's shift was over, since it's 9:30pm at this point. The guy who was there gave us a snotty attitude. I didn't appreciate his sarcasm. As a Marriott Elite member, I'm used to a certain level of courtesy when visiting their hotels. I've stayed at Marriotts in several countries in 3 different continents and this is the first time that I wasn't greeted with a ""Thank you for being a Marriott Elite member"" at check-in.  I think that the Dubai Marriott Harbor Hotel concierge folks should train this front desk staff. 

The rooms were nice and clean and the interior design of the lobby, bar and restaurants were impressive. This hotel is also conveniently located just walking distance from all of the tourist attractions. The cleaning staff was rude. They came at 10am and if you were not out of your room, they wouldn't come back or only come back and replace the towels.

The Executive Lounge is closed on weekends, which is odd to me since I'm sure there's a lot more people staying here during the weekend. However, they serve breakfast and hot food for lunch when they are open. It was all delicious.

The restaurant located inside the hotel took at least 30 mins to take our order and at least one hour to serve us.  It was a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was only about 1/3 full. Not to mention, the meal was not good at all.

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,2.0,"Great location on Canal Street and great beds. So ends the ""great"" list. 

Disappointing in many ways. Let me list some of them from my recent 4-night stay:

1. Arrived Wed afternoon with family. Discovered hair in the shower in the morning. Lots of it. Nasty ratty balls of hair in the shower wall and in the tub. When I called the desk they sent up some chips, pop and a note of apology while we were out that evening which was a nice gesture. 

2. However!! The hair was not cleaned from the shower wall. Unreal. Also, the alarm clock went off at 5 in the morning. Second morning, mind you, and it did not go off the first morning. Sooooo, I can only conclude a hotel employee did it intentionally because I complained about the nasty hair? That is downright unreal and someone should be fired. 

3.  Next day requested towels and TP and neither was delivered. Had to call 2 more times. 

4. Concierge Lounge has a great vibe--board games, great seating areas, TVs, pool table. BUT, they don't even lock the door so everyone goes in Bc it is in the lobby. It is waaay too crowded and the food and coffee run out all the time. Some lounge staff friendly, some downright rude. 

I have stayed here 2-3 times before and this may have been my last. Service is why one would pay the extra $$ for a JW property. Service needs to be consistently good in all areas to warrant JW prices. This location did not have it, unfortunately.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"The hotel's location was great, right at the beginning of Bourbon St and across lots of shopping. The room was beautiful and everything was clean and modern. The downside: the staff was rude, gave me attitude when I asked what time the bars closed, there was NO HOT WATER in the shower. There are bums all around the hotel so not good for families with children!!!! At night it's a little sketchy but lots of police around. Overall I think I might stay here again because of the location and I got a killer deal, $80 a night w taxes included. Then I complained and had to make a stink about the hot water and I was able to get my money back, so 2 stars for that.",0.11599206349206352
Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Airport,Indianapolis,2.0,"It's an okay hotel. But it's not as great as they advertise.

The staff is hit or miss, friendly and rude. They could use more training on how to not be short with their guests about useless things.

The lobby is nice. Makes it seem fancy.

The rooms are warm. They never really cool off, but they aren't miserably hot either. I wonder how it is during the dead of summer?

Rooms are overall pretty nice. Bathrooms are okay. My bathtub leaked everywhere, but I got a surplus of towels.

Everyone complains about the planes flying over the hotel. I guess I can see their complaint, but honestly the planes didn't bother me. But then again I'm around airplanes all the time, so maybe I'm just used to it.

Location is awesome for French Quarter.

Highly recommend purchasing the hotel breakfast. That was the issue with my booking that never got situated.

Rooms were nice, clean, and comfy and the historical Bourbon House  is located downstairs in the hotel that's why I give it a 3-4.

Management customer service sucks.  Front Desk Manager Sunny was very rude when we tried to inquire about a mistake with our breakfast and booking. Don't expect any quick response from Reservation Manager because who ever it it was never contacted us after 5 days if staying  there.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"I really wanted to give this place a better review, but I couldn't bring myself to give it that much credit.  From the outside as our Uber pulled up and the first impressions of the lobby I had high hopes.  We arrived a few hours before check in and thought we'd ask about checking in early and were rudely told no and that check in time wasn't until 3pm so we'd have to come back by the front desk clerk.  Luckily the bellhop at the entrance was a bit nicer and did point us in the right direction of the luggage drop.  

Upon getting to the room on the 14th floor the entire room felt dingy and dated.  The furniture was mismatched and the bathroom appeared to be out of what looked like an interstate motel from the 1980s.  The tile and grout was aged and grimy, the showerhead in the tub sprayed no harder than a kitchen sink sprayer, and there was hardly a vanity area.

I had to pay an extra $100 security deposit that I will probably not get back for whatever reason they can come up with. We had to pay to park in a public garage and walk over because their parking service was astronomical. The location was great because it's on the corner of Canal and Bourbon St. If you are not a late night outer on Bourbon, definitely don't stay here. Noise until at least 4 in the morning from all sides. The hotel also found a way to add all sorts of ""convenience fees"" at check out to make things better.

Chris- The bellhop was absolutely disgustingly rude. When we asked if cabs would be available at 6am, he leaned in with a terrifying face and said ""yes"" in a very annoyed and rude tone. I wish I would have asked him if he spoke to his mother with that mouth!
Towel situation- called for towels and waited about 30 minutes only to call again and they said the guy is on lunch break. Had to ask to have someone else bring more towels. Once the towels were finally brought, they knocked and left them at the door. Seriously gross! Our sheets had stains and were never changed.

We returned to our hotel room later that night and my husband laid down and noticed a smell on the bed; he looked through the bed and noticed all of the pillows smelled of fecal matter; my two year old son was also alseep in the bed at this point it was about 10 ' 0 clock at night. We called housekeeping and they instructed us to take it to the front desk we took it to the front desk and they called down Linda the Housekeeping Manager who smelt the pillow and confirmed that it did smell like feces they had no explanation for this and let us know they would be taking care of our stay. The next morning I was giving my son a bath and the face plate of the shower fell in to the bath while he was in the tub still, my husband brought it down and the front desk shrugged it off. On the 6th my husband and I went out to get dinner and housekeeping had came while we were out; we noticed upon coming back to the room 23 dollars was missing and my wallet was opened; it was shut upon leaving the room; we let the loss prevention team know and still have heard nothing about this incident. We checked out the following day early because our stay was god awful. The amount was refunded on to my card and then taken off and charged again a week later; I have been trying to get in touch with the accounting department for a week and a half and finally did on the 26th they said someone did the refund backwards and had to put the credit on again. My bank account has been frozen due to this issue for now a week and a half. The Sheraton and the employees have been nothing but rude and have been no help.

Now let's turn to the bath tub, it was nearly clogged with extremely slow water flow and the water was far from hot, can say warm at the best, I spent one night in a cold shower because no warm water at all.

To start I Reserved and confirmed a double bedroom asked for my gold card upgrade and she said we don't do that here?? even told the front desk clerk when checking in again. I got to my room It was A king. Returned to the front desk she said sorry I did hear you say it was a double etc etc. and gave me my new room, I walked in it was muggy stale air it was the late night I turned the air on full. and almost nothing it had to be mid 80,s. could barely sleep. In the am I went to the front desk and asked please have the a/c repaired. she said right away. I returned to the room 5 hours later and it was 90 degrees in there and the air would not turn on i called the manager and she said let's just move you. After unpacking 8 days worth of clothes e etc I moved rooms to a very cold room but the carpets looked like they had some serious stains and big wrinkles in them. The Bellman which was very nice said OMG let me change your room again1! I said no its nice and cold I will stay just have them clean the carpets when I leave in the am. That night my son arrived and all night long the new rooms a/c kept turning off and making a very loud bang. Night 2 could not sleep. Again I called the mgr this time I got the voicemail. The front desk said they would take care of it. I returned that night nothing was taken care of and no returned call.!! The next day tried to call the mgr the operator was the rudest operator ever in any hotel and hung up on my 2 times, the mgr said they would bypass the thermostat so it would not turn off and said he would give me a small credit... I told him I wasn't looking for a credit I was looking for a Marriot quality Hotel room!! this was the most worn out nasty old Marriot hotel rooms I have ever had the displeasure of experiencing. Even the room service was not up to standards. we ordered 2 burgers 2 glasses of water and 2 shrimp cocktails they brought 1 burger.

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,3.0,"Overall: 3 stars. Would only recommend staying at this location if you plan to spend most of your stay outside the hotel and don't need WiFi. 

Accommodations: We were able to easily get a room on one of the top floors with a beautiful view and both a early check in and late check out. Room was lovely and they are doing a TV upgrade soon. Bathroom was spacious although the tub was small. The outdoor pool was also open in December! 

Location: Perfect! Right next to a street car stop and within walking distance of just about everything in the French Quarter. 

Ambience: Wonderful! This hotel is spacious and has a BEAUTIFUL lobby. It was well decorated for the holidays and has a festive bar with a great menu on the first floor.

Now for the bad...

""Extras"": There was no mini fridge in our room, although you may have been able to ask for one. The WiFi comes at a charge (not cheap either) and we called to ask if they would waive this. Although they said that they would, we still were charged and had to have it waived in-person. In addition, even with ""buying"" the highest speed, the WiFi was incredibly slow. We were unable to watch TV at any normal resolution.

The staff: Hit or miss. Had a wonderful bartender but somewhat rude front of house staff who didn't seem to know answers to relatively basic questions. In addition, the line to check in was quite long, but I did visit during a busy season.

Noise levels: The walls of our room were very thin. We could hear much of what was going on in the room next to us and even woke up to their alarm. The hotel wasn't particularly full either, so would have loved if we weren't placed in a room attached to another family's given the thin walls.",0.19356532356532355

The cookies were really good and warm if you got them at the right time, if you have nut allergies they only have cookies with walnuts. Bringing up the cookies, I personally think that they should have had an alternate choice for people with nut allergies.

However, we were there the day before Christmas Eve for a Saint's home game. They weren't rude, but they definitely were not welcoming.

We got reservations for this place for a very reasonable price from a third party site. Would definitely recommend if you want a place to stay that is in walking distance from everything.",0.08611866969009828
Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Downtown/Convention Center,New Orleans,1.0,"For my birthday, my friends surprised me with a trip to New Orleans. I was nothing but excited as we made the 5 hour drive from Auburn. They told me of the nice Courtyard Marriott they had booked, which was right by Bourbon street. However, this ""Marriott"" was everything but nice. The issues began we we arrived at 11 am. They said that our room was not quite ready. We knew the website had said that check in was at 4. Okay! ""We can hold your bags behind the desk!"" Great. We gave them our bags and went out to explore New Orleans. Around 3:30 pm, we were ready for a nap. Surely the room was ready 4.5 hours later right? Wrong. The lady behind the desk was quite rude and dismissive, saying that our room was still not ready. We sat in the lobby until exactly 4pm, the check-in time promised on their website, and then went back up to get our keys. Nope. Things continued to tumble downhill. At this point we were informed that balcony rooms took longer to clean, and at 4:30 the room was STILL not ready. Why would you not start cleaning earlier then? We asked to speak to the manager who told us that housekeeping was in charge of the rooms and he had no control when they finished cleaning each room. I'm sorry sir, what? Isn't the point of a manager to MANAGE? Eventually we got the room. Problems continued to arise, like my friend getting charged extra for the valet parking, and the front desk charging the wrong card. After a very disappointing stay, we went to check out at 11. The front lobby was extremely unorganized and after finally checking out, we had to wait 53 minutes to get our car from valet. While Marriotts are usually very nice, I am embarrassed for Marriott that this disheveled establishment is associated with such a highly respected name. My friends and I could have slept on the streets of New Orleans with all of the homeless people and probably had a nicer stay. I would not recommend this hotel for my worst enemy, even Nick Saban.",0.05367183742183742
Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Downtown/Convention Center,New Orleans,1.0,"I will never stay here again unless the city is oversold due to an event and I feel compelled to burn points for the stay.  The walls are so thin I could hear everything going on next door (and the neighbors weren't unreasonably loud either (though that's not the only noise issue--see below)).  The room furnishings are dingy and dated, even by Courtyard by Marriott standards.  The staff was so standoffish and/or incompetent during my recent Mardi Gras stay it crossed the line to rudeness (more below). 

HOUSEKEEPING, WHAT HOUSEKEEPING?  I asked three times for housekeeping to service the room, each time was condescendingly assured they hadn't forgotten about me and would indeed come--but, no surprise, housekeeping never came.  I of course complained about it (politely, but understandably with a touch of pique), got no apologies and no offers to make substantial amends, but they did at least send up towels and glasses.  Why isn't housekeeping around until very late during the weekend before Mardi Gras anyway?  I also had to chase different housekeepers around the building--when they were actually in--to get coffee, since they were too lazy to grab some more when they ran out and stock my room properly.  By the way, I do have the decency to tip housekeeping regularly, which I gather is not universal, so I'm a little irked when I can't even get coffee, which should be standard, but I even requested it.

NOISE.  The staff is horribly lazy and/or indifferent.  It was 4 in the morning and people were having a party in the courtyard.  I had to complain three times to get anyone to do anything about it, and I'm not completely sure the hotel staff actually did intervene--it could have been that by 5:15 the party had just broken up on its own.",-0.059711538461538455
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,1.0,"We have been trying to check in at the Sheraton New Orleans Hotel on Canal street for hours now. There are people lined up in the lobby, littered about the bar area, and even a few outside who can not get to their rooms. When we asked the front desk what the hold up was, they told us a plethora of excuses -- most of which ended up with ""we overbooked.""

That is a borderline acceptable excuse for people who booked their reservation a day or so in advance, but we had booked this reservation months in advance. The hotel's inability to keep their reservations straight demonstrates an unprofessional attitude that is also represented by their staff. There are many other families and guests in the same situation that we are in and the front desk is rude, unhelpful, and unapologetic. This is a disgrace to the Sheraton name and this establishment is unfit of the 3.5-4 stars that it shows on many travel sites.

There is a Marriot across the street that might be a better option.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,2.0,"I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights. The hotel is nice and clean. My room was clean. Location not too far from Center City. Upon arrival I was greeted warmly and given my delicious cookie. Second day I had a question about access to the pool (I asked if it was openly accessible or if there was an added charge because its located in the health club section). Damien thought the question was silly and laughed in my face. He realized he should not have done that and said ""oops, sorry"". When it was time for me to check out my name was not found in the system. Reason being, I was mistakenly checked at 5am! I was told that someone with a similar name checked out at that time and my name was clicked by ""accident"". Very careless act. Also, during checkout, I got into a verbal altercation with the young lady at the desk because of a misunderstanding about usage of the parking card. At check-in I was given the card, but I chose not to use it because i did not want the parking fee charged to the room. I was not told that parking was automatically charged to the room. So when I questioned that charge it brought on an attitude. The young lady's tone was extremely disrespectful which caused a heated verbal confrontation. In the end everything was squared away but the level it was taken to was ridiculous.",0.10972222222222226

I needed to find another hotel, the valet told me he could not call for one, I had to go on the street and flag one down and the only reason I had to get a taxi is because he had buried my car so deep he could not get it out in time for me to make an appointment.

- Lots and lots of street noise makes it very difficult to sleep.

- Male front desk staff is always rude and unhelpful.

- A/C unit did not work in the room, I left for 7 hours came back and was still not fixed.

- Normal hotel check out is 12 noon, here it is 11am. When you ask for late check out at 2pm, you are given extremely unfriendly attitude.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,2.0,"My feelings are a little bit of a mix for this place... 

I love Crowne Plazas and I trust the IHG hotels' standards, nevertheless this experience wasn't up to my expectations.

From the moment we arrived the Valet lady was rude and pushy when we asked about parking. We were just inquiring about self parking when she practically laughed and said we would have to walk a lot. Even a second lade whom a suppose might have been a supervisor approached her to change her way of communicating to us.
I understand is New Orleans and Bourbon Street but I know there's parking everywhere! Here they actually charge you $41.00 per night for valet. I didn't mind paying for it because we had my grandmother with us and I didn't want her to be walking long distances, but the price is outrageous.

We approached the Front  Desk and the lady who checked us in had 0 personality. Very bland and straight forward in a city with soul and charisma. I had reserved a specific type of room and of course they didn't have it available and I could not wait for it so I took what was available. She assigned us a room in the 12th floor.
When we headed to the elevator they were giving them all (a total of 6) maintenance. Again...I had my grandmother with me and I was NOT going to make her go up so many stairs.

After waiting for the elevators to be running again we dropped our luggage in the room and went straight to the Bourbon Street (which is half a block away from the hotel) and the French Quarter and did not come back until close to 1 am. 

Upon returning I noticed that our breakfast hanger was dirty and all filled out, that a tag from shirt from a previous guest was left next to the ice bucket and that housekeeping had forgotten about a polishing rug inside the night stand's drawer.
I used the bathroom to go pee and when I flushed the toilet got ""clogged"" and the water never stopped running. My bathroom was becoming a pool so I had to inform the front desk. 
When maintenance got to the room, the gentleman didn't even greet us and seemed annoyed with the issue. He couldn't fix it right away so he just cut the water flow and left. At this point the carpet was all wet.

The MOD didn't even bother to call or follow up so I had to request to change rooms, and I was moved a couple door away.

Now, this room has stains in the carpet and the sheets had holes on them, but it was pointless to report it.

We were hungry and wanted to order from the room service menu which is 24 hrs, but... the menu was limited and nothing you would ever want to have as room service.

At the end we only had an hour left in the hotel since we were leaving early in the morning (3am) so we went to bed for an hour and forgot about everything  else.

Checking out was a little slow since the clerk was printing all the folios to be left under the guests rooms checking out that day... but to help us he said he would ask valet to get our car while he checked us out.

After all of this we go out to the valet stand to find out that he had given them the wrong ticket number and that it could take up to 15 min to get our car.

It was truly an adventure....

DoubleTree by Hilton Tampa Rocky Point Waterfront,Tampa,3.0,"This was a tough one to rate.  While the staff were consistently 5 star in their attitudes and service, and the room was quite comfortable, the fact is it was very inconvenient simply because I hadn't driven there.  And though the shuttle they provided (at no additional charge) took people wherever we wanted to go, it was just too isolated from most everything except a couple restaurants within a half mile or so.  

Of course, being a typical hotel billing itself as high quality, combined with the isolation factor, the price of the food in the in-hotel restaurant was stupidly way higher than it should have been.  $18 breakfast buffets are just not very pleasing to me since I don't eat like a pig.  On my last morning there I got wise and just ordered from the menu, got the same mid-quality eggs, bacon, and potatoes I had gotten in the buffet, and saved $6, though even $12 is $4 or $5 more than it should cost.  

I ordered dinner the first night and asked for a well done burger.  Apparently the cook thought I had meant -cooked so long it's shoe-leather dry-.  

They have a ""business center"" with a few workstations (with extremely limited access to the web forced through a Doubletree branded browser that didn't allow me to do much of anything that wasn't pushing Doubletree / HIlton offers).  Fortunately I had my laptop with me.  The problem I had was when it came time to print out documents.  They have this stupid functionality where I had to upload my docs to some generic web printing service.  

That in turn got me some six digit code that was supposed to allow me to print - I assume on the one printer they had in the room.  But it never did work.  And since I was doing this on the morning I had to leave at a specific time, I ended up abandoning the printing attempts.  

Our event was held in the wedding tent they have near the pool.  Yes, it's a big wedding tent.  White, with white interior, with chandeliers for lighting (really?  Chandeliers?) Oh - and they had white christmas lights spiraling up the tent poles and along the wall/ceiling areas.  Fortunately those were left off for our business event.  

The tent has air conditioning (Extremely loud, by the way) - and when it was on, it pushed it's air up, over the pitched roof of the tent and down onto those of us sitting on the far side.  Which meant we were freezing when it was on, and the people sitting directly next to the air conditioning were actually sweating that whole time.  Sad. 

Overall it was a great stay because I was there for a business conference and so my experience was biased due to how much I enjoyed being with my peer industry friends.  And the staff really was helpful in the few things I needed them for.",0.027237784002489888

Tried contacting the hotel directly again, got sent to an IHG call center.  IHG call center said the room would be 30 dollars more than the advertised price (is that bait and switch, especially after they had already run my card?).

Rooms weren't ready at 4pm -- time for check in. Ready by 4:45pm.

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"Naw,  skip this one unless you are into huge money factory with very little return.  Lots of better hotel choices in the area in equally good locations that you will actually enjoy and get some return value. This hotel has a  huge tip operation where you have to sit in line that goes several blocks down very busy Canal Street and around the block.  We burned gas in line on Canal for an hour just to get into the valet area.  They do not have any option to self bag or self park.  You will get a swift kick from the hotel staff if you try it.  They get quite rude if you try it like I did.  I had to walk back to the car down the street and wait.   Problem is they only have a single line to get cars into the valet area. Only here can you get your bags out, get the car parked,  and of course tip everyone for the pleasure of waiting in line so long and burning all your gas.  Its funny to watch the hotel staff with large rolls of tip money counting it in the lobby and in the elevators.  They seemed quite pleased with their loot. They could get at least 3 rows of cars into the valet area instead of the single line and use the back gate for an exit.  This would improve the traffic flow and get more cars off the street faster,   but more staff would be required.  Guess its hard to find people who need jobs these days...right?     Don't forget anything in your car for you are not allowed to see it again,  unless you want to wait an hour for them to bring it down again. But to park it again,   you have to head down the street several blocks with your car and get back to the end of the line again.   I expect you get the pciture here now...laff.   The rooms are small,  forget housekeeping.  They are real slow and non english speakers, so any requests are not possible unless you are multilingual.

A rating of 1 isn't fair though as the property itself is well-maintained and most of the other staff we interacted with were much more pleasant.

As soon as we walked into the hotel, you could tell the front desk agent was in a mood, while the other was helping another guest. The lady, didn't look at us once but asked the gentlemen at the desk, ""do they need help?"" No, I guess we are standing at the front desk with 5 bags for absolutely no reason. After 10 minutes, she reluctantly helped us, by finally (in a stern tone) saying ""what can I do for you"". After checking us in, without providing any hotel details, she assisted the couple behind us...very happily might I add, making me question whether this was a racial profiling issue.

Courtyard by Marriott New Orleans Downtown/Convention Center,New Orleans,1.0,"We had a very unpleasant experience. 

1) We were booked to check in on Monday, October 8 and check out on Saturday, October 13. The night we arrived, there was no room available so we were directed to the Residence Inn nearby. We booked for 3 people but found a room with only a queen bed at 2:30AM. The pullout couch was so disgusting and old that my fiancé ended up sleeping on the tiny couch. The toilet was also broken and it took 45 minutes for service to come. Terrible, terrible, terrible.

Fine. We weren't able to check in until after 4PM. We weren't able to shower or change our clothes, which essentially ruined our first day in New Orleans. Also, service was TERRIBLY rude. 
3) We called Marriott to complain about this, and instead of handling the matter, we were redirected back to the lady at the front desk (who had just rudely and coldly told us she could not help us).
4) I am an SPG platinum elite, and at every hotel I get a greeting and welcome gift option. I got none of this, AND I did not receive points for my stay. TERRIBLE.
5) There was no complimentary coffee available.
6) Toilet broke AGAIN. Someone came within 20 minutes, but why??

In short, I will never stay at a Courtyard again unless I absolutely have to. The property was tired and service was bad. It's a shame, because the location is convenient.",-0.15026170798898073
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"This is about the rudest staffed hotel I ever been too. The all day dining menu in your room isn't really all day. It is from 11-1 then 5pm, etc. I said it says ""all day dining"" but it really isn't and the in room dining person on the phone just hung up. I was down stairs at the Pelican bar for 30 minutes to try and get a drink and sandwich bc you can't order in your room - even went to bar and was told someone would be around. Well forget that I left the hotel and went down the street. They must only care about cost savings or something because they certainly don't care about service. I will say the lady that helped me check in was extremely nice - Justina. I also called guest services for a question and was on hold for 7 minutes. I get that if you are calling certain places but at a hotel !!  I've only been here a few hours and I don't have much nice things to say.

 2.  No hot water - first they said it was because the cruise ship came in then they had other excuses.  After asking the 3rd time they had security come up to talk to me.  It was after noon before they had hot water.

JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,4.0,"I haven't stayed at many Marriott's but I have stayed here for the past two years of Jazzfest and think it's great. So conveniently located. Nice sized rooms, that are super clean. Comfortable beds and linens and towels.

Love the breakfast there - my favorite homefries!! I was waiting all year for them after having them last Jazzfest. 

Great service and friendly people minus the woman who makes the omelets and waffles for breakfast. She's rude and clearly hates her job.

Really, a great hotel - very comfortable.

Biggest downside is that they charge for internet in the room by day for $14.95 yet it's free in the lobby and other locations in the hotel. Biiig mistake, big mistake, huge! (Sorry I watched Pretty Woman in the hotel, and couldn't get that quote outta my head)",0.2935326086956522
JW Marriott New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"Thankfully the group of people I traveled with are all good spirited individuals and we were determined not to let anything ruin our trip - but man alive did this hotel sure try. 

1. they messed up our reservation and instead of the adjoining rooms we'd requested, we were all crammed into one room with a roll away bed - so we were required to move rooms our second day. We were annoyed, but these things happen I suppose. 
2. when we called and requested a hair dryer and champagne glasses be delivered to our room - we waited over one full hour before calling to remind the front desk of our request. We then waited over 30 minutes before calling a THIRD time about the same request. When they came they failed to bring the hairdryer - but promised us it would be delivered shortly. You can probably guess, we had to call AGAIN after waiting another 20 minutes. Almost 3 hours and 4 phone calls later - they got it together enough to get one hairdryer and 5 glasses delivered properly. Why we didn't just check out then I will never understand, and certainly regret.  
3. We had to call the hotel our third day there at 3pm to request that someone come clean our room - they didn't arrive until 7:30pm that night - we'd already cleaned it ourselves so we said not to bother. 
4. The concierge was who I personally found the most repulsive - we were met with attitude when asking for recommendations for dinner and when we asked for help with tickets for a show at House of Blues we were informed that there was a business center we could use to book them online ourselves. If you are hoping for anything other than her to circle the location of the hotel a little 3-fold map and give you walking directions to a restaurant you've had to research on your own - - then just skip it, because that's all this woman does. 
5. Obviously once we'd caught on to the fact that the service in this place was an absolute joke - we proactively went to the front desk to make sure that we wouldn't be charged twice for internet when we were forced to change rooms because of their mistake.  - We couldn't help but laugh our faces off when it was still on the bill slid under our door 2 days later. These people are terrible at their jobs. 
6. We were there for a friends birthday, when her husband tried to send a bottle of liquor to our room with a card as a lovely surprise the concierge again was unhelpful and rude. He ended up needing to call me so I could go down there and speak to the front desk myself - considering they mark-up the cost for these bottles 300-400 dollars, you'd think they could put a little more effort into nto screwing it up. But no. Did I mention these people are terrible at their jobs. 

The only worthwhile people in the ENTIRE hotel are the door men who help you with your luggage and hail you taxis. They're charming and lovely and quite frankly are too good to be working in such a miserable place that is otherwise devoid of any traces of hospitality. I hope those guys get offers to go work somewhere better, somewhere worthy of their caliber. 

I normally love Marriott properties - they're always my top choice. I was even willing to look past the jackhammer in the lobby and the nauseating smell of wood varnish because I understand in the hotel industry renovations are necessary - but the complete lack of consideration for the guests experience while staying there - is revolting. Literally every single thing the staff (Doormen excluded) was a part of was sloppy, thoughtless and quite frankly had a seriously negative impact not only on our trip, but on how I will view all  JW Marriott properties moving forward.

The parking fee wasn't even waived for military personal which is piss poor.  It took over an hour to find a park due road closing for Mardi Gras. I called the hotel multiple times to ask where to park. I was put on hold countless times. Two of my friends also called at the same time hoping me would hear a voice on the other end. Finally we got a response and was told by a staff member to park at a lot down the strip because it was ""cheaper"".  The cheaper parking spot was an inconvenience. We had to navigate through the wet dirty streets with our belongings to take to our over priced room. The room was standard and certainly not worth 300 a night. Another secret charge was for the wrist bands that you were forced to wear to enter the establishment. We were told that if we lose the wrist band we would be charged for another one. The night staff inside the hotel that checked wrist bands were rude. Gawking and yelling at people for not listening when they never made it clear who they were talking to.

Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,1.0,"**CUSTOMER SERVICE IS A JOKE**I wasn't going to write a review until I was lied to by the Front Desk Clerk Daria and Jena the Front Desk Manager on two different occasions. After explaining what happened, both ladies promised I'd be refunded for the $259.90 charge for valet (2 cars for 2 nights each), including an unexplained $50. Today, I received an email from Maritoni advising valet said I left a note with them stating I'm parking 2-cars for the duration of my stay, which is a BOLD face LIE. 

I am very disappointed with how valet services handled the situation I during my visit. I was in NOLA to celebrate my 40TH Birthday with friend from 8/10-8/13 and I selected the Sheraton hotel when I could've easily going anywhere.  I was charged $259.90 for valet services and I never valeted a car during my entire stay. When I explained this matter to the valet company, the manager acted as though he had no understanding. He eventually told me that someone need to take car of the charges because someone charged their valet services to my room (1806); but he couldn't provide me with the car make/models. How could this happen to a guest? Shortly after I spoke with the valet manager, I went inside and spoke with the front desk clerk: Daria. Daria, assured me that all charges would be removed. When I asked for a receipt, she informed me that she couldn't give me one now but that I can in the morning when I checkout the hotel.  When I asked for a receipt from a new clerk the next morning, ALL $259.90 charges were still present and no one was in a position to assist me again.  I truly feel like the valet manager and Daria both dropped the ball by failing to rectify my concerns, the incorrect charges and/or do what's right by removing the charges from my bill. Therefore, I will be taking my concerns to corporate and hopefully, I'll be able to obtain some fair treatment as I didn't know anyone off the streets could valet their car(s) and put their charges on any persons' room at the Sheraton hotel and the guest be held responsible to pay for the charges. To be clear, I paid $341 for the weekend stay with the said hotel and I was unfairly charged $259.90 for valet and I never parked a car. How is this fair???

P.s. I just want to ensure this does not happen to anyone else by to bringing awareness to those who may be oblivious to these types of hotel scams.",0.09809182046024151

Extremely excited because of the awesome location(which was great) only to be greeted with the front desk not having our reservations of 4 rooms even though we had called and confirmed a couple days before. Arguing about our confirmations even though we were showing them the emails. After finally figuring it out we had to wait almost 2 hours for rooms to be cleaned even though we arrived way after check in hours. They offered us $100 credit to the bar(for 15 girls) only to have the bar tell us they aren't run by the same company and that it didn't work... mind you after we already ordered drinks. Rooms were nice,spacey and clean. We stayed 5 days and every single day none of our 4 keys worked... so EVERYDAY and EVERYTIME we left our room we had to go down and get new keys! Horrible and super inconvenient during a bachelorette party. The only good thing that came from this hotel is the two security officers who constantly had to come let us in our rooms...

Fairfield Inn & Suites by Marriott Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,2.0,"We made a reservation on Expedia for a special Valentine's Day trip. We checked into the hotel and were given our room keys. When we got upstairs we were given a room with two double beds instead of a king bed like I had booked online. I showed the woman at the front desk the email from Expedia stating I had reserved a king room. She told us that when you book a room you are given whatever is available and not the room that you choose. Essentially we had booked ""a room"" and did not have any specific type of room. I showed her the email again and asked why it said king room on my reservation if we didn't actually get a king room. She didn't answer the question and just kept stating we booked a room but not a king room and if we wanted a king room we would have to pay $20 extra. We ended up paying the $20 because who wants two double beds for Valentine's Day! We paid $35 for parking which was convenient because it is connected to the hotel and the convention center. They told us our room key would get us in and out of the hotel parking garage. When we tried to exit the parking garage later that night our room key wouldn't work to let us out. We tried pressing the call button but it just kept telling us ""error"" and wouldn't open the gate. Eventually a guy who worked at one of the other hotels jumped out of his car and swiped his card to let us out.

The lady on the phone asked me what was wrong with the room and before I could even finish my first sentence I was abruptly told ""just come down here and we'll see what we can do"" then 'click'. Very rude. 

When I came down I was told I could join a waiting list for a new room. Fine. I asked to be put on the waiting list and went to check my bags at the bell stand. The bellman told me I shouldn't have keys if I was waiting for a new room. What? I spoke with a supervisor that told me I was still assigned to the room and there wasn't actually a waiting list and I would need to come back after noon to see what was available. 

The room is also right across from the elevator and the walls are paper thin. You can hear every word from people waiting to get on the elevator. 

The final straw for the quality of service was the thick layer of dust on the window and the clock that was set 5 hours into the future. Simple things.

The restaurant prices & room service was a bit steep for me, so we used Uber Eats, which gave us variety & was cheaper than the hotel's restaurant prices. We only had two real complaints, even though we were guaranteed a late check out, housekeeping woke us up early (there was no do not disturb sign to put on the door) thinking we were checked out already, someone from the front desk knock on the door stating that we would be charged for another day if we stayed past 1pm & tried to hand me an envelope with the last name Jones on it, my last name isn't Jones so that was concerning. The other complaint was with the shuttle driver, Sydney or Sindy, he was rude, drove recklessly fast & passed our terminal & when we requested he go back around, he refused, stating that it was his last run & he couldn't, even after he saw me limping to the shuttle & I had explained that I had injured my knee.

The location was great. It was conveniently located on Canal Street, across from Cafe Beignet and on the corner of Bourbon Street! Really, though, that's one of the only good things I can say about it. 
Check in process took forever. The man at the door said the system was down and people were lined up out the door to get checked in. There was a man directing traffic in the lobby, and he was really rude to me when I misunderstood something he said.
The building is older but fairly well maintained. The interior is pretty. We got a room with 2 queen beds. The beds were the most uncomfortable I've ever slept on in a hotel. We both tossed and turned all night and agreed it was pretty terrible. There was no refrigerator in the room, and I didn't find out you could request one until the last day. It would be helpful to know when you check in. There was a tall window dominating the center of the room, but one of the curtains had brown stains on it and outside the window was just a view of a wall...but also a dozen rusty cans and old bottles. Not having a view was fine and expected...but the trash was just sad. Also, one of the few outlets in the room wasn't working at all.

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"This was a beautiful, immaculate gorgeous resort. 

Sadly, unlike similar resorts in its class the poor service and blatantly rude, unfriendly behavior from staff was why we rate this a 1. 
For my ""green book"" travelers and other ally's, beware. 

The valet staff was rude and not very helpful with the exception of a nice young API woman (Cindy I think).  

We were questioned more than once on whether or not we have a room at the establishment....  Seriously, no one drives through the desert in the boonies if they don't have a reservation. I'm 90% sure the staff were told to treat certain guest ""differently"". 

Next the front desk woman didn't bother to greet me or give me eye contact when I checked in. The rest of the trip went downhill. 

Let's just say it was clear ""our kind"" we're not welcome at the resort. 

I was hesitant to stay in Arizona but decided to bypass my best judgement and went with our friends from multiple states on a multi family trip anyway. I'll trust my judgment next time. 

I have never been so ready to leave a resort in my life! What a huge disappointment for our family. We won't be vacationing in Arizona frankly anytime soon and sadly never at this establishment again. It is very beautiful and the grounds are immaculate. I'll give credit where credit is due.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"First of all- The staff is so unfriendly.
When they cleaned our rooms, they didn't even wipe down the counters! We also ordered room service the night before and when we put our plates out the next morning, they stayed there until our departure which was 2 days later!!! Horrible!
Chris- The bellhop was absolutely disgustingly rude. When we asked if cabs would be available at 6am, he leaned in with a terrifying face and said ""yes"" in a very annoyed and rude tone.
Towel situation- called for towels and waited about 30 minutes only to call again and they said the guy is on lunch break. Had to ask to have someone else bring more towels. This is service I would expect at a motel... Very disappointed in our experience with this hotel and will not be returning.",-0.2414957264957265
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"I am a Marriott fan but was extremely disappointed in this hotel. The staff was the most rude I'd ever encountered. The front desk person who check checked us in never smiled or spoke to us. She did not put my Bonvoy number on the reservation though she said she did. We found out after calling for another reason. We had to go later and have someone else do it. 
The attendant in the concierge lounge was extremely rude - slamming things around and mumbling under her breath. 
Three employees standing in the lobby to help people (though were just chatting with each other) could not answer a simple question about which street to take to get to Woldenburg Park which was a few blocks away, on the river, and didn't offer to try to get info or tell me who might be able to help. 
We did have a good experience in the lobby bar. The bartender and server were very nice. As well as was the omelette cook in the restaurant. 
Also, our room was very dusty when we checked. We cleaned it ourselves. 
I've never had an experience like this at a Marriott property and was surprised. 
Extremely disappointing. I'm not even a demanding or rude guest. I make it a point to be kind and patient with people.",-0.0008333333333333464
Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"The person that booked the reservation made a mistake and did it on another name which is incorrect. I acknowledge this error right away and called the hotel reservation department. They told me they fixed the issue but it wasn't fixed. When I was checking in I had to clarify this again and then when checking out the hotel did not provide me the invoice with my name on it and they said that it was impossible to fix this wrong name in the booking. Conclusion, I've paid for the room but did not have the legal invoice to submit the expense (as this is a business trip). The IHG chain did not provide any answer neither credited my points for my staying. 
I do not understand why I should be accountable for a mistake done by the person that took my reservation, by phone, which is a Crown Plaza Employee. I addressed this issue in person at the hotel counter when checking in/out, the person there said that they were not able to change the reservation's guest name, but they let me check in...as a result I was not able to get an invoice on my name which is unfair as I still need to submit this expense and do not have the legal invoice yet, although I asked for them in many times. 
I understand the precedent facts are affecting me financially as I can't submit the expense with a bill naming another person, and also personally as this affecting my rights to earn points for my staying at the hotel.
I found the service provided by different hotel employees, in person and by writing, unrespect full and in certain point discriminatory as they are crediting my points to somebody else which looks like has connections at the hotel.",-0.013541666666666676

Hyatt Regency Tampa,Tampa,1.0,"There were only two maybe three staff members I found nice and caring. First was the lady we checked in with, then the second guy who helped us with our stuff and the lady at the coffee bar, I enjoyed her the most and she was extremely pleasant all three times I saw her.

I guess from here I will go in order of events. When we arrived the valet seemed to be trying to do things too quick. I brought a mini fridge with me and had it in the back seat a particular way. Me and my friend started taking it out but the valet insisted he do it so I tried telling him exactly how to do it but he wouldn't listen and just started yanking it out, scratching the hell out of the inside part of my door. I even told him it needs to stay flat on it's back since I stored a few things in there to save space in the car and of course she tries to sit it up on the cart and the door pops open almost sending everything into the street. What looked like a supervisor came by and told him to leave it so he walked away and then no one help us at all after that until everything was on the side walk. After we filled the first cart half way another guy came over and was very helpful, he made sure things were handled with care and made sure it was alright to move. I wish I got his name but I have to go park the car and I didn't see him again.

Next when we got to the room we found a cockroach. Took a picture and went down to check-in and talked to a new lady that was there. All she said was sorry. I stood there for a few seconds looking at her and she just looked at me...finally she offered to send up housekeeping, I refused since it took her so long to even offer it. The room was also very dusty, I look a finger and wiped it on the window ledge and it was disturbing how much was there. I have dust allergies and I started getting sick that night.

I ended up bringing a small rice maker which got dented in the fridge incident. Tired plugging it into an outlet which then proceeded to make a crackling noise, spark and start smoking. The rice maker doesn't work anymore so I went hungry for most of the weekend. The lady at the desk just took note of which outlet it was.

It seemed everyone involved in the weekend event at the hotel was getting treated badly. After attending events such as these I have never been treated this way, like the hotel didn't want us there.",0.041572676572676576
Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"This hotel was a very last minute resort for us. We were originally booked to stay at Bourbon Orleans hotel which was suppose to open up in March (they were unfortunately still closed due to renovations) we had booked through a third party so we used our credit to stay here which was probably the worst mistake ever

Pros:
Close to bourbon street (which is what we were looking for)

Cons:
Blood on sheets
Glass on floor
Broken window
No hot water 
Rude staff
No room service
No cleaning service 
No answer when calling the lobby
No manager available 
No room to move you to due to being fully booked

Mind you this was all upon arrival. The sheets on our bed were the wrong size we noticed one of the sides coming up that's when we tried to adjust it and noticed blood. I called the lobby...phone rang and rang no answer. Went downstairs explained the situation the staff didn't seem to care they said they'd send someone up (no one ever came) Later that day as I was walking around I stepped on a piece of glass! Called room service again informed them about the glass and cracked window asked to be moved to another room, was informed they were at full capacity and if something opened up they'd let me know but they asked me to reach out to who we booked with. This place was just beyond HORRRRRIDDDD.

The front staff is very unwelcoming and unfriendly, they don't seem to care about ANY of your concerns. Not once did we deal with someone who said hello or greeted us in a kind matter.

The parking situation is a bit tough. Valet is the way to go but you have to wait in a very busy and long line on a very busy canal street. The front desk staff look warn down. Granted we visited on a very busy weekend with a Saints home game. The staff wasn't rude but wasn't very welcoming. The interior is beautiful. 

The rooms are nicely decorated and have nice views. We had a great view of bourbon street. The rooms even provide ear plugs for the noise on the street. However we didn't hear noise at all and slept soundly. On the website, it says each room can be accommodated a roll away bed. They told us at check in that they can't since we were in a room with two queen beds. They may want to update that information.

While staying here (7 nights) on our 4th night the alarm in the building went off at 3AM evacuating everyone. During this time no staff assisted anyone, being that we had to use the stairs closest to us on the way down we came into an area that was smoky and what seem to be a fire extinguisher dust! Our stairs led us out a flooded area on the street there were other hotel guests with us some elderly and they had a hard time getting through the area. When goin back inside the alarm went back off, at this time guests became upset including myself when asking the man behind the counter what was going on, he had no answer and ignored everyone's concerns when asking to speak to a manager he stated he was the manager, and walked away again. With our giving anyone an explication or an apology, another guest stated that she works for a hotel and that his lack of empathy and lack of concern for the guests was disgraceful and that everyone should call corporate at this point this man became very nasty with the guest and told her that she was making the situation worse, yet still no explanation or apology! The alarm went off 3 times, still nothing from staff!.They all went to a back room and ignored guests! Corporate was called and made aware they were very apologetic and understanding of the frustration. No answers still. When we finally got back to our rooms and to bed the alarm went back off at 8Am 3 mores times again no answers finally at 930am we finally got an answer from a man who just came on his shift and he was very helpful!

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,5.0,"I'm unsure of what people are talking about when they say they had rude customer service, poor rooms, etc. We had a great 5 day stay here.

My husband and I booked through Orbitz and it was easy peasy. At check in, we got there at about 1ish? Check in isn't until 4 but they had rooms available - I simply asked the gentleman for the best room we could get and he gave us as room with a view of Bourbon - though the window was 2'w x 5'h, it was still nice to be able to look outside instead of at a wall.

The rooms felt very clean - we actually only had room service come once in the 5 days we stayed because they stocked us up with so much stuff it was unnecessary for them to come back multiple times.

We had NO problem with noise, bugs, black hairs or anything. Once in awhile we got a hint of sewage, but it came from Bourbon street and we weren't in the room enough to really notice it.

It was a great location with great service. If you want to stay in the middle of the party scene, stay here because it's nice to be able to walk right out onto Bourbon. It's great.

When we checked in and got to our room, we noticed that the room only had one bed. I went downstairs to tell the lady at the front desk that we paid for 2 beds rather than just one. She stated that they were ""overbooked"" and only had rooms with one bed available. I told her that that's ridiculous and we already paid for 2 beds. If they were overbooked, why would we be able to reserve a room in the first place? She gave us a few options. She told us that we could cancel our reservation and go to another hotel, get half off our room, speak to their manager, or they could bring a sofa bed. Giving me half off the room doesn't do anything because it doesn't fix the fact that 3 adults and a teen CAN NOT fit onto one queen bed. Redirecting your customers who already paid for a room to another hotel is rude. If I paid for a room with two beds, I expect a room with two beds. Why else would I book in the first place???

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"I honestly expected a lot more from this place seeing as it was listed as a four star hotel on the site we booked with. The price of the hotel is a little more than I would typically pay but since it  was my first time in New Orleans and I would only be there for a little over 24hrs, I wanted a great location in the midst of all the ""action"". For location, the hotel gets FIVE stars. It's on the corner of Bourbon and Canal and is in walking distance to lots of the famous spots in N.O. including the ""strip"" that has great shopping and restaurants. 

However, location is the ONLY thing that makes this hotel FIVE star worthy. 

When we pulled up in front of the hotel, the bad impressions immediately began. There was a large bus parked in the hotel's valet parking spot BLASTING not only incredibly loud music, but music laced with profanity. I mean, I'm not a prude at all but I had my mom with me and I was honestly embarrassed for her to hear that. I understand the hotel has no control over who parks in front of their hotel but I would imagine that the valet attendants and security guards who are already standing outside would ask them to turn their music down--they didn't. So, we had the privilege of listening to that garbage at the highest volume you can imagine the entire time we were unloading our vehicle. It took us a while to unload because we were on our way to Texas for a week so between the four of us in my party, we had a lot of stuff. 

Once inside the hotel, I tried to let that first bad impression fade away because the hotel lobby really is beautiful. It exhibits the exquisite opulence of a bygone era and ""Regal"" is a word that comes to mind to describe it. My mom sat down on a beautiful couch in the lobby area while she waited for us to check in. There were two ladies behind the desk. One was dealing with another guest and the other starting check us in. Neither of the ladies bothered to greet us, welcome us to the hotel or anything. The one who dealt with us was chewing gum the entire time and furthermore, she never looked up at us. She checked us in with efficiency but with no warmth, professionalism or customer service. 

After checking in, we met up with mom who said that while she was sitting in the lobby, an employee of the hotel, (we think he was a doorman or bell-hop) was apparently upset with someone and was cursing up a storm in the lobby and saying that he's done with ""this place"". ""Well"", I thought. ""Obviously this hotel just keeps getting better."" *sarcastic snarl* We hadn't even made it to the room yet.

When we entered the room, it wasn't spectacular, and I expected more for the price, but it was okay. I walked over to check the view and there was none...just a dismal view of the tops of some buildings. Oh well. 

We were tired so I just wanted to shower and go to bed. I got into the shower and was appalled by the state. The tub was dirty, the ceiling was peeling and it looked like there had been water damage and the water pressure was a trickle. 

I tried to just lay down and forget this hotel ever existed but then the sheets were dirty--I doubt they had been changed from since the last guests. I had to put a t-shirt over the pillow just so I could feel comfortable enough to lay on it. I ended up getting a very poor night's sleep.

The next day,thankfully, it was time to check out. There were four of us but we still had a LOT of bags so we decided to call the front desk to have a porter sent up. Ten minutes passed, no porter. Fifteen minutes passed, no porter. We called again and waited another ten minutes and no one ever showed. So we just lugged ourself downstairs ourselves. 

On the bright side, after checking out, we were allowed to leave our baggage in a small holding room so that we could do some shopping and sightseeing before collecting our vehicle. We were able to go to breakfast, cafe du monde's, walk down bourbon street looking at art and shop for a few hours all while not having to worry about our luggage or parking. When we got back our car was waiting for us in the front of the hotel already so that was good.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Wedding Night from Hell:
We booked our room for our honeymoon weekend. We booked the room several weeks in advance. A week prior to the trip I began trying to contact the hotel to inquire about having some wine/champagne, flowers and some chocolates left in the room for us. I took me 3 days, several email and phone calls  to finally speak to someone to help me. The woman I spoke with was very impatient and rude to me. She told me that I would need to FAX a form to them in order to order these items. It is now the day before the reservation and I did not have access to a working fax machine. I told her this and asked if i could email her the form and/or give her my credit card over the phone. She said they could not take credit card information over phone or email and that she could not help me. At this point I was considering cancelling the reservation and trying my luck at a new hotel, but I didn't. Eventually, after speaking someone else, they apologized for the inconvenience and offered to provide the items I requested free of charge. I thought that was a really nice gesture and decided to move ahead and hope that the poor customer service was receiving was just a fluke and that it would all be fine once we got there. I was wrong...

My beautiful wife and I got married and drove down to New Orleans. We parked our car in a public lot as we found out that the Astor Crown Plaza charges $47/night to park (the lot we parked in was only $15/night). We arrived at the hotel around 5:30. There was a long line and it took almost an hour to get to the desk to check in, which was fine because we had drinks and we were still very much ""after-glowing"" from our wedding and beginning our life together. We get up to our room and our first thought was, well its small but it was fine. We had a window looking over Bourbon Street which was nice. However, none of the items I had ordered were in the room. Still not that big of a deal...we can save the champagne and stuff for later. We showered and got ready for dinner. Before leaving the room, I called the front desk and let them know we were still waiting for the items (flowers, chocolate covered strawberries and Champagne). I told them we would be gone for the next 3 hours and asked if they could please have the room setup when we returned. We went out and had a great dinner and enjoyed the city. We walked back to the hotel and guess what? Still, nothing is in the room. I called the front desk, and until this point I was nothing but polite and patient, but it was now midnight on my wedding night! I informed the front desk of the issue, they were VERY apologetic and told me they were upgrading us to a ""suite"", everything was set up and that they were sending someone up to help with our bags. Ok, fine...maybe it will be a great room and will make up for all the BS we had been experiencing. So we pack our things and get ready to move to the new room and we wait...and wait...for an hour and a half! Its now 1:30 AM, my wife is crying because we both wanted this night to be perfect, just as I am about to go to the front desk to speak with them, someone comes and brings us to our ""suite"". We walk in and the rooms smells horrible and its basically the same room we just left, except there are NO windows and they have the bed in a separate ""room"" that is just barely bigger than the bed. My wife and I are NOT difficult or high maintenance people and if those were our only complaints, we probably would have just kept to ourselves and gotten on with our wedding night. So, I take a deep breath and go to the bathroom, thats when i notice my feet are in a puddle...of toilet water. There apparently a leak at the bottom of the toilet and now the bottoms of my shorts are soaked in toilet water. Then, I hear my wife scream in disgust...I come out to see what else could possibly go wrong; there are several pubic hairs on the bed And Im not talking about 1 or 2 hairs, I mean...MANY short and curlies covering the bed spread. We are both pretty upset now and dont even feel comfortable sitting down in the room. We call the front desk, once again. This time its my wife and she is crying. We asked for a manager to please come up to our room and that we'd like a new room or at least our old one back. We wait about 30 min and there's a knock on the door. Finally, we're gonna get this figured out so we can move on and enjoy the rest of our trip. I open the door and who do i see? The janitor! That's right! the janitor, and hes here to fix out toilet and mop up the mess...ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT! At that point I had had enough and had lost any hope that the staff at this hotel cared at all about the experience their guests have. I WANT OUT.

Daily in room 6606 we were met by a loud ""eeeeee"" sound that seemed to be plumbing related. Needless to say, it was constant as water is always being used in a hotel. 

Video of the sound as well as the electrical plug-in that wasn't properly installed will be attached to this review If possible. There was also a random dirty napkin left on the floor of our room, presumably from the cleaning staff, as we hadn't ordered any room service while we were out of our room. SMH. 

Overall this place looks great online but once you're there you'll see that you were sold a bunch of garbage. FYI the pool is very small and appears to be poorly maintained. Oh one more thing one of the two elevators for the ""Alexa"" tower was broken for a number of hours which also adds to waiting times to get to your room or down to the lobby.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"Nine of us  planned a 3 night stay at this hotel due to the good reviews but we should've gone somewhere else that was worth our money and a better view. Prior to arrival I was hung up on 3 times when trying to contact the hotel about connecting rooms as agreed upon in correspondence emails. When we arrived the front desk denied hanging up on me and were rude and unprofessional when we finally checked in. The room was in decent condition but when we tried to order more towels no one answered the phone and when we asked a worker who had towels in her cart for one she said no you need to call for it. Furthermore,  during our stay there were two fire alarm evacuations for no reason  at unconventional times. The first time it happened we had to walk down 8 flights of stairs and when we were allowed to go back in the hotel the elevators were closed and the staff told us we had to wait in a long line for the elevators to turn back on and couldn't take the stairwell which was a lie. Afterwords, on the way up to our floor we saw a mouse trap with a dead mouse in it. Our showers were also cold.

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"Never again!!!!

Booked a Room for Friday and Saturday this last weekend at your hotel for my twins 9th birthday (which we normally do since their birthday is so close to forth of july (7-6-11).  Got kicked out of the pool around 7 o'clock (sat) because of a thunderstorm completely understandable but it took out your electricity and you didn't even have backup security lights and the power was out for 5 hours which meant our Room went from AC cold to completely freakin hot with us sitting in it to hear word from ANYBODY!!!!  Last night The only answer I could get from the front Is that it is out of their hands and something in God's control..... Power did not come back on until 1130 last night we decided to pack up our belongings and head home because it was just too hot for me and my infant to sleep in the Room!!!!! Left my name and number at the front desk to figure out what they were gonna do for this situation. I got a call today only to find out that nothing was gonna get done no compensation no small percent discount for the inconvenience absolutely nothing!!!  I had my family members reserve 3 other rooms because we came there to celebrate the birthday on Saturday at the pool... We were kicked out of the pool early and didn't even stay in our Room I do not see how there is no compensation for the situation.....  One of my family members who booked a Room only for Saturday  Wasn't able to check in till 4 which means they were only at the pool from 47 and then kicked out sent to the Room and had to sit there and wait until we heard from somebody from the front desk which we didn't until we walked up there to figure out what was going on!!! I'm gonna make sure everybody understands what happened to me on my kid's birthday weekend and to never plan a Room with you guys during monsoon season because if it's something that happens you guys will absolutely NOT take care of it OR TO BE accountable for anything that happened on your property and that's absolutely fucken ridiculous!!!!

We were not the only guest that were told you just respectful answers and decided to up and leave!!! In total for all of the rooms we rented from you guys we spent almost a $1000 if not more..... And none of us got to sleep in our Room Saturday night technically we only stayed one night.... I would appreciate some small percent off but all I got was the answer of we're not doing anything sorry!  We have a birthday next weekend For one of my nieces all of the family was going to continue booking rooms for the following weekend so we could enjoy some outside pool fun together But we already looked into the star pass resort we will be staying there from now on!!!!

The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,2.0,"I think that this may have been ""the place"" in the past, but they seem to think that they are the best and only resort.

The lounge staff are immature, rude and the service is terrible. I gave it 6 full days and nights and 2 years in a row and I haven't changed my mind. If it weren't for the conference I was attending, I would not have even come back for a second day.

The newly renovated rooms are not much better than the old ones except for a big bathroom, but there was a light bulb missing and since we opted for no linen changes (their green program) we also got no coffee, shampoo or anything else until we called a few different times AND left a note on the door. They also proudly advertise a daily 5$ voucher for not having daily linen changes....we got 2 for the six days and nights we were there.

The gift shop employees seemed irritated that we would want fragile items boxed.....for a flight back to the East Coast.

The conference rooms were either cold enough to need a jacket or so hot that it was impossible to pay attention.

The food was terrible and very expensive. There were only a few things to pick from so it was easy to try a variety of things from the menu and everything was loaded with salt and served as if you were at a truck stop diner. This ""diner motif"" was completed by something stuck to at least one piece of silverware every day. You would think that when you are asking for new silverware every day because something green colored is stuck to it, that SOMEONE would look into that.

It's a shame because for most of us, conference or not, it's a beautiful part of the country and takes a lot of saving throughout the year. I'm glad that the conference was good.",0.0035742035742035746

I told him I was at my bank n I had been charged, he then told me not to worry it was a pending charge, I then told him the charge had already gone through. He was so rude and argumentative. All he had to do was apologize n credit that charge back but instead he acted like a jerk and was dismissive. He was training a new front desk person at the time n all I could think of was what a horrible example he was setting.

Delta Hotels by Marriott Indianapolis Airport,Indianapolis,1.0,"Upon arrival to the airport I called and spoke with Cory at the front desk and asked for a shuttle. He stated it would be 10-15 minutes. 30 minutes later when it still hadn't arrived I called back and got Cory again. When I asked for an update since it had been 30 minutes he replied with ""Actually it has only been less than 15 minutes"". He wanted to tell me how the drivers had to drive the speed limit and he couldn't see where they were because it was against the law for them to be on their phones. He said they would be there in 10-15 minutes and to be patient. An hour and 15 minutes later I call and get the front desk manager who was unaware of my need for a ride as Cory was gone for the day. The maintenance guy had to come get me. Upon check in I was told that the General Manager Emory was going to talk to me because now I was an hour and a half in but he was on a call.

At this point I was not surprised of such a lack of communication amongst the staff at The Delta. Emory gave what to be felt a sincere apology. Gave me his card and asked me to contact him directly the next time I was going to be in town and he'd take care of me. I was coming back a month and a half later so I called him multiple times and told he wasn't there.

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"The staff can care less that your there and are rude, unhelpful, unprofessional, and simply just don't care. It appears that at sometime in this hotels life somebody who ran things cared about the quality and integrity of it but that is long gone. This place is filthy and not kept up at all. From the lobby to your room to their Fitness room. The lobby furniture is covered in dirt. The couches were a dark maroon color and that could still not hide the dirt and dust that covered them completely. Staff did not code my room key correctly so I had to walk down and ask to have it redone and ask to make sure I was at the right room. The front desk girls were all bitchy and barely acknowledged me. I had to ask three times to make sure it was not my mistake of having the room number wrong before she would answer me ""no it was the card she did not code right"".

Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,3.0,"For starters the location is perfect if you're going to be eating and drinking on Bourbon, if that's not what you're into maybe find another hotel. While staying here (7 nights) on our 4th night the alarm in the building went off at 3AM evacuating everyone. During this time no staff assisted anyone, being that we had to use the stairs closest to us on the way down we came into an area that was smoky and what seem to be a fire extinguisher dust! Our stairs led us out a flooded area on the street there were other hotel guests with us some elderly and they had a hard time getting through the area. When goin back inside the alarm went back off, at this time guests became upset including myself when asking the man behind the counter what was going on, he had no answer and ignored everyone's concerns when asking to speak to a manager he stated he was the manager, and walked away again. With our giving anyone an explication or an apology, another guest stated that she works for a hotel and that his lack of empathy and lack of concern for the guests was disgraceful and that everyone should call corporate at this point this man became very nasty with the guest and told her that she was making the situation worse, yet still no explanation or apology! The alarm went off 3 times, still nothing from staff!.They all went to a back room and ignored guests! Corporate was called and made aware they were very apologetic and understanding of the frustration. No answers still.

DoubleTree by Hilton Tampa Rocky Point Waterfront,Tampa,1.0,"Friends, followers and fellow Yelpers, do what you can to stay away from this hotel.  I have been treated bad at my fair share of hotels, but hands down I have been treated worse here than any hotel in the country and in the world!   I agree with so many others what I say, STAY SOMEWHERE ELSE!   

I love the DoubleTree brand, they are usually extremely nice, and provide excellent service from getting your warm cookie at check in, to a nice smile and have a nice day when you check out.  The DoubleTree Suites by Hilton in Tampa Bay fell hard from all the marks and made me feel pretty bad.  I am a Hilton Gold member and I have to say this was bad.  

Let's start with the details.  First, I checked into the hotel around 4 p.m. which is when it says you can check in.  I get to the hotel and it was a very pleasant exchange, we were even given double cookies.  The guy who checked us in said they were giving us a suite which made us pretty excited.  We came to figure out pretty quick that every room is a suite and what they gave us was a standard room at this hotel.  This is was not what was upsetting.  

We used the pool at the hotel which was nice and after using the pool we decided to take showers before heading out for the night.  My friend who I was with and I both realized when we took showers that the water was not hot it was pretty cold.  I decided to call down stairs before we went out to get it fixed since we were leaving the room.  

Fast forward 3 hours when we get back to the hotel the guy at the front desk says he needed to speak with us.  He started to say that after we left the maintenance guy came to the room and when he tried to fix the water it exploded and water went everywhere.  We noticed that all of our stuff was placed on a luggage cart and was behind the front desk.  They told us that someone came in and grabbed all our stuff and put it on the luggage cart.  This was the first thing, my friend was kind of freaked out someone went through her stuff.  

Then the guy working said that the hotel is sold out and he does not know what to do with us.  He gave us a drink ticket and said he would be back with us very quick.  This was at about 9:45.  At 10:30 we had finished the drinks they gave us and went over to check for if we have a room.  They said they would get us a room but it will take 20 more minutes, because apparently they had no one to clean this room.  11:00 p.m and they finally put us in a room.  We go up to the room and they decided to give us 1 king size bed.  When I made my reservation we had 2 beds and paid for 2 beds.  I decided to go down stairs and the guy said this was all they had and they thought we were married and thats why they gave us 1 king bed.  What?!?  don't make the assumption that because a guy and a girl are friends and staying in the same hotel they are married.  The guy starts to get very angry who is working the desk and tells me a lot of lies and told me I was misusing the system because I asked for the original room we had booked.  

It was not until I said that I wanted to leave until he some how magically found us a double room with two beds.  It took me to threat asking for a manager before I could get any help.  They did not get us into a room until midnight, and we checked out at 7 a.m. the next day.  I am sorry this was the worst service ever and I felt attacked and abused by a hotel employee.

Holiday Inn Express Philadelphia - Penns Landing,Philadelphia,4.0,"Stayed here to take the kids to see some of the historical sites in Old City and the Seaport Museum at Penn's Landing. We arrived around 10 AM and planned to just park and head into the city, but when I went in to confirm with the front desk that it was okay to leave my vehicle prior to check-in, they informed me that they had rooms available, gave me the keys and allowed us into our room. Very impressed with that, and it was a precursor of a very nice stay. This is a pretty good property, as long as you come in with your expectations appropriately set.

 ***PROS*** -Very good location! There's very little in the immediate vicinity (although Cherry St. Pier is right across the street and D&B's is right down the road), but it's an easy 15-20 minute walk or a $10 Uber to Old City or a 10 minute to Penn's Landing. -Views! Be sure to pony up the few extra $$$s for a Riverview room. It's worth it! -Room condition. Our room was exactly what we expect from a HIE: clean, comfortable, plenty of room. Nothing fancy, but it delivers what it promises!

 ***CONS*** -It can get LOUD here. Half the rooms face I-95, the river view rooms face Columbus Boulevard. Staying on a Friday night, there were quite a few street races and ATVs blasting down the Boulevard off and on from about 10 PM all the way to 2-3 AM. Even on the 6th floor and with the sound machine that we travel with on, we were woken up several times. -Parking. At $30 a night, it's pricey for open lot parking. You DO get unlimited in-and-out privileges, but still. -Breakfast Buffet safety. It was nice to see a nearly fully stocked breakfast buffet again, but there were very little mitigation measures in place, and no one present to correct the guests who ignored what Was expected (several guests walking back up to the buffet maskless, touching items then putting them back, etc.). 

All in all, we enjoyed our stay here. It did exactly what we hoped it would do as a home base for some Old City sightseeing for a family. The noise was a significant issue, but there's very little that management can do about that. Bring a sound machine, some ear plugs and plenty of hand sanitizer (and maybe your own breakfast!), and I think you'll be pleased with your choice.",0.20734801587301582
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"This was my 3rd stay here at the Sheraton. Past experiences have been great. The location next to the French Quarter is convenient to walk to-lots of bars, restaurants and shops. My family had 3 rooms reserved and we were placed on various floors, not a major problem, but a definite inconvenience. 

Pros: Elevators were quick. Room was clean. Bed comfortable. Valet staff very helpful. 

Cons: The front desk staff = rude. A/C in the room. Our room never cooled down at all.  Our TV volume was stuck on full blast. We would turn it down or mute it, only to watch it climb back up. So loud that we couldn't watch TV at all.   Water pressure was super low-we joked about the low flow shower heads on Seinfeld. The last night of our stay we received notice that the water would be shut off entirely at 11pm until 5am. (Maybe this is why the pressure was so low). Not cool. No flushing toilets. No showers. No water to wash hands. We had an 0600 flight out the next morning and we were all hot messes to say the least. When we went to check out via TV, the system wasn't available until 0400 so we went to the front desk and their computer system was down. She advised our final bill/receipts would be emailed to us when the system was back up. It is now 2 days later and still haven't received a copy of our bill.

On the bright side(?), the loud A/C unit and bathroom air helped cover up some of the noise, and I had to turn on the TV to additionally cover up the noise next door so I could sleep. 

Luckily, the second night was so much quieter and I barely heard anything from our room. I read some reviews of people hearing airplanes overhead due to the proximity to the airport but strangely enough I didn't hear them at all while we stayed here.

The front desk attendant was friendly and speedy at checking us in, but was a bit too speedy because we didn't receive the free breakfast vouchers we were supposed to get. I didn't even know my hotel stay came with free breakfast had my friends staying in another room not mentioned it. It's continental style, served from 6-10 and includes make your own waffles, yogurt, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, various carbs (Bread, bagels), juice, milk and coffee. They do have soymilk in addition to regular milk but it's next to the oatmeal rather than at the coffee station for those that want milk alternatives in their coffee. There's a hot breakfast upgrade for $5 which looked like it had some sort of cooked eggs (Probably scrambled), bacon and sausage to name a few items.

The room we got itself came with a fridge, microwave, and small coffee maker. There's a small balcony on the 2nd floor rooms. Ours was overlooking the lawn and pool. The room is tiny and the bathroom even tinier. You can barely walk in and close the door to the bathroom. The bed was comfy at least.

The bathroom had quartz shower walls and countertops with good water pressure and the tub stopper had a few spots of rust but the actual tub was very clean.

There's not a lot of shopping or food options in the surrounding area due to its location. 

We chose this hotel mainly because we were headed further south the next day and the airport hotels were the closest places to stay that were in a major city. Due to the thin walls I'm not sure if I'd stay here again.",0.029981746031746033
Crowne Plaza New Orleans French Quarter,New Orleans,1.0,"I have stayed at this hotel twice. Once was with a formal and once was with a group of friends. 
Both times I checked into this hotel, I was yelled by the staff. At the formal they made us sit on the floor and yelled at us for 15 minutes before we were allowed in our rooms. I understand that they wanted to prevent problems but they treated us like kindergarteners. 
The second time I checked into this hotel it took over an hour. They told me my reservation was for the wrong date even though I received a confirmation email that said the right date. I even called to confirm a couple days before. They said they had internal problems but then acted like it was our fault. It also took over 30 minutes to get our car from the valet. 

Not only does this hotel hate young customers but it is also very noisy. They actually provide earbuds in every room because of all the noice. The bedding was so uncomfortable and this is coming from a person who normally sleeps on a college dorm mattress. But the main reason I would never stay at this hotel again because of how unorganized and disrespectful the staff is.",-0.0748015873015873
The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,1.0,"Sad to report that my experience with La Paloma was not exceptional. The resort is GORGEOUS with great amenities, but customer service and staff are unresponsive & rude which has tainted my entire experience. Hidden and illicit charges galore. When customer service told us these charges would be removed, they were not. I have had to follow up 3x in the span of 2 weeks just to get a response.

I also experienced an extremely disturbing situation that has yet to be resolved - one of the men on a security/cleaning team stole my (dirty) bathing suit bottoms (and another article of clothing) that I accidentally left behind in the room. When I called to see where they were located and if I could come to pick them up, I was told he was in possession of them and had been terminated from the resort so they were unable to contact him. Why did he take my dirty bathing suit? What is he doing with it? La Paloma informed me that I would be receiving reimbursement for this, but again, I have yet to receive a response. Extremely embarrassing on their part.

Overall, there are other places in Tuscan that have the same value for a much better price. I was expecting luxury and was unfortunately met with disrespect and disregard.",-0.09249999999999999
The Westin La Paloma Resort & Spa,Tucson,3.0,"This is one of our favorite resorts we have been coming here for 20+ years. I got married here. Overall it is still one of the most beautiful spots especially in the fall, you can't beat Arizona weather. The grounds are beautiful and well-kept, the pool area is wonderful as well. The rooms however have seen better days. Extremely disappointed with many aspects of the room. The carpet was filthy, I let my son crawl around and after five minutes his knees, feet and hands were covered in black. They need shampooed at the very least, replacing would be better. We had to stuff towels under our door as we could see light coming through. It is the Southwest and we were amazed that something like this hasn't been caught. Who wants to wake up to a scorpion or snake in their room? We were appalled that something like this is acceptable especially for the price and the name. The walls had dust bunnies, leak stains on the ceiling. Also the beds used to be one of our favorite parts of staying at the Westin. The ""heavenly"" beds have turned quite hellish as they were the hardest beds we've ever slept on. The lounge chairs at the pool or some of the most uncomfortable we've experienced as well. Lots of disappointing downturns at this resort. We encountered two women at Starbucks working one older one younger that were quite rude and grumpy and the valet was as well. Frankly we expected better of the Westin.",0.14172413793103447
Sheraton New Orleans Hotel,New Orleans,2.0,"I am currently staying at the Sheraton Hotel on Canal.  I am changing my review from 3 stars to 2 stars.  I'm here for 4 days and 3 nights.  No one cleaned my room on yesterday.  No one cleaned my room on today.  

The parking is also very hectic.   There was one time, where it appeared that it took 5 workers, to deal with one guests lost car keys issue.  Why did I have to be impacted by that if there were enough workers to get my car, while one person could have dealt with his lost car keys issue.  

I also have to say that they need to highly invest in new remote controls for their televisions.   Trying to use their television remote had to be one of the most frustrating experiences of my stay.

The remote was slow to react to every press of the button.  There were times that I had to pray to keep myself from wanting to just throw the remote at the television.  

Even when I scanned the code to use my phone as the remote, I had the same issue.  Please fix this so that your guests can have a more pleasant stay.  It should not take almost 30 minutes to log into Netflix because the television is slow to react to the remote.  

On another note, I inquired about a refrigerator before I traveled.  I was told that my concerns would be forwarded.  I was given the impression that a refrigerator would be available.  

There was no talk about a first come first serve basis on refrigerators before I traveled.  Yet, when I called the staff like 4 times regarding a refrigerator, I was told that they would check.  

It's okay to check.  It's even okay to even not have one if they are all checked out.  Yet, the issue is that the staff NEVER followed up with me regarding whether they had a refrigerator or not.  

The staff simply ghosted me each time and never followed up.  This is downright disrespectful.  You should at least call to let your guests know whether they will be accommodated or not.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"This hotel gets absolutely no stars from me. It was not because the hotel wasn't nice. Well I only saw the lobby. It is because of the 2 staff members that were extremely rude and disrespectful. I do not remember the woman at the front desk's name but I do remember the hotel manager. Some friends and I were there for Made in America festival just last weekend and my friend booked a room here for one night. We get to the hotel, wait in a long line to check in, just to find out that the hotel staff made a mistake of booking our room for August 5th. My 2 friends are calmly trying to explain to the front desk woman that this is wrong and she gets very nasty and rude and tells them they need to wait to the side because she has other people to help. At this point my friend gets upset and raises her voice. The woman tells my friend that she can leave the premises so she calmly walked away. We finally speak with the hotel manager, his name is James Moore, and he comes over to my group and I to ask what the situation is. He tells us the hotel is overbooked and that he will try to call around to other hotels, but is sure other hotels will be booked too. He didn't really want to accommodate us and didn't try. When he came back instead of having a solution he made the situation worst by belittling us, telling us that we were wrong, that we were probably lying about booking a room, etc. His tone was demeaning and he even said ""I'm not giving you a reservation, in fact I'm not doing anything for you guys"" and walked away. I couldn't believe that this was the hotel manager treating his potential hotel guests this way. I was stunned. He should be fired and the woman at the front desk should be as well.

When we arrived, however, they gave us a room with one bed, and one old, extremely uncomfortable and blanketless pullout sofa. They charged us for everything. For one car, overnight parking, it was $12. And they wanted to charge us another $12 for Wi-Fi in the room?? The management also was very rude to us because we were younger then most of their other guests. Please, save yourself the trouble, and never, EVER go to this hotel.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,3.0,"I've been using Embassy Suites as my  hotel of choice in the city for years now. You can't go wrong with a room that sleeps 6 comfortably ( bedroom with two doubles or queen, and pull out couch in a massive living area), great location on the parkway, free breakfast in their ajoining TGI fridays as well as a free cocktail receiption nightly for their guests. 

This time around- I ran into a problem that I was kinda annoyed about. Around 2 in the morning- my brother and his two friends returned from a gig that he was playing. They were stopped in the lobby and told that they must present proof of their stay or I had to check them in. So I went down to check them in- I was told I needed my id and that I'd also have to pay an additional $20/guest. The woman at the desk was rude and even mocked me.  I understand that most hotels charge you more if you have extra people- but seriously, what hotel actually polices that! I was pretty annoyed.  Parking is rediculous too at a whoping $40/night! 

Overall, I'd say that I'd return to the embassy just because you can't beat the price and location for what you get. I will be more cautious of the late night staff on patrol. They definitely lose a star for that.",0.06005291005291006
Embassy Suites by Hilton Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"We went here in this past March (2017) and it was under construction and was loud and dusty the whole time.
We came again in late June (2017) thinking the whole place would be done, however it was a complete disaster.  It was still extremely loud and I felt as if I was in a fog while walking through the hotel because of all the dust.

During our experience during March, walked into the room to find a big stain on the comforter cover, the maid was trying to tell me that I could keep the stained cover, but she eventually changed it out.

We got a newly renovated room both times. The air conditioner didn't work in March but wasn't that big of deal because, well it was March. In June our air conditioner didn't work again, so we called the front desk and they said they would come and get it fixed.

Long story short, 5 days later still broken air conditioner, 4 calls to the front desk to try to fix it.  I finally went down and told them that we needed a new air conditioner or a new room.  They glady sent someone up.  Air conditoner did not work, and the whole room had a nail salon smell then.  We eventually changed room to a cool, but outdated suite.

We also had a meeting room where we ate our food. The ceiling actually fell down and water was dripping out of the hole.  They continued to serve us lunch as they were ""fixing"" the ceiling (just taking down the rest of the tile that had fallen).  They moved us to a new meeting room and a tile came down in that room the next morning.

Most of the people working with the guest are positive and polite, but the parking attendants were rude.   Also, it doesn't matter how nice your staff is if your hotel is subpar.

I would have given this a 0 out of 5 but you cannot so, here is your free 1 out of 5 embassy! Congrats!",0.03310308972073678

Then when checked out were charged taxes for valet. Wow!!!! The rooms are quaint but very small... Pet friendly but no court yard for the dog to use so had to walk to a nearby hotel who had a court yard... Also, some of the staff were afraid of my dog even when he was in his kennel and being held.

Doubletree by Hilton Tampa Airport - Westshore,Tampa,4.0,"I've stayed here about 5 times over the last year.  My girlfriend and I love it, especially at $40 a night with Priceline's name your own price.  They almost accept $40.

We love the mattress and bedding of the Doubletree hotel brands, it sleeps superbly well.
Another great plus is the ability to hook our Xbox 360 to the TV and watch our videos that we have saved. 

We've had a few issues with rather rude members of staff but also have had a few go above and beyond, so it's really hit or miss. 

Positives:
Bed!  It's a great pleasure sleeping on these mattresses
Room Size
Nice Pool
Pretty good location
TV (has HDMI hookup)

Negatives:
Internet speed - even with paid
A/C
Parking
Staff hit or miss

To elaborate on the negatives, the first one is parking.  It's really horrendous and the side parking garage is difficult as there aren't elevators.  Come on a busy weekend, you'll be pressed to find a spot.

Internet is $12 for 24 hrs and you barely pull .5 Mbps.  And if you have several devices, it's a per device charge although if you do ask the front desk they might be willing to remove additional charges per day.  But honestly, I'd rather surf from my room than the free wifi in the lobby and the charge still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  Although there is a business center with several computers for use.

Getting into the Hotel is easy and the location is great with a lot of places within a quick 5 minute drive.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,5.0,"We had a lovely visit to Philadelphia and our three night stay at the Embassy Suites was a significant part of that.   My husband made reservations at this beautiful, centrally located, well priced, hotel, Spring 2016.  The building itself is a 28 floor, extruded dodecagon shape, and is easy to spot from the many businesses, historic landmarks, museums, parks, and beautiful public spaces within a 30 minute walking distance.  We drove to the hotel and the valet service took care of parking for a reasonable price.  Inside amenities included the 2nd floor hospitality floor with a walking bridge to a TGIF for a hotel sponsored happy hour each night of our stay - though my husband only stopped in once, and they made our son a special kid-friendly drink. There was a hotel sponsored breakfast in the lobby each morning, with made-to-order omelettes, and a buffet of pancakes, French toast, and baked goods, as well as some 8-allergen free options: home fries, bacon, and fruit.  Our suite:  We had a kitchenette in our beautiful and clean hotel room, which included a microwave and mini-fridge, coffee maker, and sink.  There were no cutlery, glasses, bowls, or plates, in the cabinets and drawers, but a quick call to the front desk helped fix that.  The bathroom was pristine, and stocked with fresh plush towels and toiletries daily.  The furnishings were well cared for, but had been well loved by guests.  Hospitality: The staff were approachable, personable, and professional; they went out of their way to make us feel at ease.  The front desk, valet service, and cleaning staff looked for opportunities to be of service.  The staff made the experience at the hotel really lovely.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"We had the worst experience possible at this outdated Hilton hotel! To start, the entrance is odd with noone available to assist with direction or luggage. We travelled from SC by car with a 2 1/2 year old. I was left to get her up the tiny FIRST elevator with our luggage cart while my husband figured out where to park the car (only self parking). The front desk staff was rude and seemed annoyed to be at work. When I asked what our room number was, the short responses was ""the same one you requested on the Hilton app"". This is the hilton app that also states ""room request is not guaranteed"". The refrigerator had to be replaced as it didn't cool and we needed it for our toddlers food and milk. Again, when I called the front desk the receptionist asked if we wanted ""someone to fix it now?!?!"" When I responded ""yes, please"" Andrea's response was ""(sigh) alrighty"". The TV in our bedroom had to be ""rebooted"" twice by staff (Mary was incredibly pleasant and friendly). The internet didn't work in our bedroom area. Hairs in bathroom, hair barrette on living room carpet leading us to believe it hadn't been vacuumed. Stains on carpet, no safe in room, bedroom sink clogged. One day we received no housekeeping and had to go to the front desk at 5pm to get towels to shower. Intoxicated football fans chanted disruptively in the lobby during managers reception, which is open to the whole hotel. This went on for roughly 10 minutes. Eventually the guests left on their own accord, nothing was said by the manager. When I politely discussed our experience and concerns with Dilbert, the manager, he was rude and rather dismissive. My husband was then yelled at by a bell hop when parking the car and loading our own luggage at check out. I guess the employee decided to show up to work on the Sunday of a football game to make some tips because he definitely wasn't there to help when we checked in during the week. Unbelievable experience. I'm not sure what is (or isn't) going on behind the scenes at this property, but it was not typical of Hilton or any hotel for that matter. It was truly a bizarre and uncomfortable experience.",-0.016003787878787885
Holiday Inn New Orleans-Downtown Superdome,New Orleans,1.0,"If I could give this a negative, I would, just based on how myself and friends were treated at this hotel. The amount of disrespect and unprofessional attitudes were beyond unsatisfactory.

First off, checking in was a daunting task. The front desk, receptionist, Roxanne, was loud,  and reluctant to work with us. She was calm, cool and collected and even friendly when it came to the other guests but with our group, her demeanor changed. She made it clear, she wasn't happy with our presence. She gave us 1 room when clearly it was supposed to be 2. We didn't realize her mistake until we went up to look for the rooms. We went back down to the front desk and asked for adjoining rooms and she acted as if she didn't know what we were talking about. Then she was behaving as if we were inconveniencing her! She was not welcoming at all. Then to add insult to injury, she told us to wait to the side so she can check in another new guest as if we were already done. When she realized we were still waiting, she just passed us off to another front desk rep, Donovan, and he was happy to help us. 

With a group of 5+, we had no bell hop service or anyone to help us with our bags, we had to move from the 16th flr. down to the 14th floor because of Roxanne's mistake. The keys were constantly not working. Each time we went to the front desk to find out about our keys, she looked at us like we had no business there. The other rep would just reactivate it without much fuss. I've never had such a problem with keys not working this much at any other hotel.

We had an incident with the security guard, Robert,being real rude and unprofessional. His tone and actions were uncalled for and hurtful. We went to the rooftop pool on the 8th floor which was okay. 10pm, the pool closes and he told only our group to leave and not the Caucasian couple to leave. He then proceeds to lock the door and act nasty like we had no business being there. Meanwhile he politely & calmly talks to the couple and makes it seem as if we were being unruly and irate! We go to the front desk to inform them of what happened and the supervisor immediately says that he ran the cameras, why would that even be needed? It was appalling to treat us as criminals and we did nothing wrong. It was even more outrageous that our concerns fell on deaf ears. The asst. manager, John truly apologized for the staff's behavior but that shouldn't have been needed. The staff should not discriminate against us because we are educated, how we spoke, our skin color or whatever issue they had against us.

Restaurant- The hotel had a restaurant downstairs. We only ate there for breakfast. The food was good and the service was decent.

Rooms- the rooms are an average size but the beds are small. For future reference, don't think about coming here with a big group and sharing beds, it won't have a good result. Each room we saw had a balcony. The garbage cans didn't have garbage bags the whole time we stayed there. The bathrooms needs improvement. The toilets in the bathrooms were real low in height, as if you were being potty trained, definitely not comfortable for tall people. The water pressure in the shower was weak and low. It wasn't refreshing at all. The rooms did have a microwave and a small refrigerator. Our fridge was defrosting so it was leaking onto the stuff we put in there.

Service/Housekeeping- Loud and slow. We had called down to the front desk for extra towels and toilet paper and they took well over an hour to bring it up.You can clearly hear housekeeping in the hallway when you are trying to sleep in, which either means the walls were thin or they were just that loud. My last day there, they woke me up saying they thought I checked out already! It wasn't even 7am and checkout was at 11am. Then she slams the door, goes to the adjoining room, slams the doors, locks it and starts making a ruckus in there. It was so unprofessional. I didn't know what to do. Upon check-out, I did report her actions to the front desk, but I'm sure it fell on deaf ears once again.

I have never felt uncomfortable staying at a hotel like I did here. I cannot honestly tell anyone to stay here knowing what my friends and I went through. Overall, you can stay here at your own risk, I would not recommend it. Maybe we came during a bad time, which is crazy because it was for the French Quarter Festival. A suggestion for them would be to do proper training in hospitality, customer service and to not discriminate!",0.01768478435145103

Ended up my daughters friend was able to cover the bill. Received a credit card receipt today which said hotel charged me for the room as well. Another call to the hotel!!! I told the manager that this one room was the hardest, most hassle-filled booking I ever made in my 50 plus years of life! I should have used Expedia as they had a similar rate. This hotel is incompetent from the reservation department to the management. I would not trust giving my credit card to this group. I'll be looking for incorrect charges on my next bill. All this for one room over one night! Never again will I go near a Homewood Suites Hotel!",0.06096793831168832
Hyatt Regency Indianapolis,Indianapolis,1.0,"Our initial room had a super noisy AC unit that clicked and whistled. At first they refused to move us and were pretty rude about it but after continued discussions they eventually moved us to a normal room.

Next was the worst part, the valet said to pay him for self park and he would put it to our account. I paid him and we parked the car. When we left there was no record of the payment. The Valet Manager and Front Desk mangers both were defensive, combative and offered no refund. 

I've stayed at hotels around the world and of course including some Hyatts and I've never run into a problem were the managerial staff was so rude and unwilling to even try and be helpful. On top of that they basically right off the bat accused me of lying about the whole thing. It was nuts!

I was not crazy angry or anything when I approached them, it even took me a second to realize that this was not just a discussion but an actual aggressive confrontation. I was just not expecting that the managers to come off so accusatory and combative.

Terrible customer service by any standard, we won't ever be back which is no loss to us because Indy has many good hotels right downtown.",0.030641821946169764
Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"First of all, the only parking you're going to find at this hotel is the $50+ valet parking. I looked this up before hand and decided to ditch my rental car and just get a ride to the hotel.

I was here for the Society of Women in Engineering national conference located a short walk down the road to the Convention Center. I'm well aware that I look young but the ladies at the desk could best be described as rude. They treated me like I couldn't possibly have the ability to afford to check in here. When she finally acknowledged the fact that yes, I was in legitimate need of checking in she asked if I was a member of the Hilton Hhonors rewards program to which I said no. Most places would ask if you're interested in joining but, nope, she didn't even offer. I knew this was going to be a pricey stay, so of course I wanted to join and had to ask her if I could. She turned around to toss a gift bag with bottled waters and candy at me and muttered some welcome speech as quickly and quietly as she could. The gift bag was nice, she was not. Not a great first impression when you're introducing someone to your loyalty program.

The bell and valet boys were all very sweet and helpful. There was a lot of construction so the conference shuttles were almost impossible to see and they would always come in the lobby (it was freezing outside!) to tell the conference goers when they arrived.

My room was very large and spacious, but other than that lackluster. Standard hotel vibe that feels outdated because every hotel room in the past 15 years has looked identical. The breakfast was your typical hotel buffet style but I have to give a shout out to the super charming man that was working the omelet bar. Honestly, give that man a raise! He is so sweet and puts everyone in his (never ending) line in such a great mood for the rest of the day. He exudes happiness. I also appreciated that they had a non-dairy milk alternative because that is SO HARD to find at hotels.

All and all, it's just another hotel. You're paying mostly for location, but if I'm paying $1200 for 3 nights I'd probably search elsewhere. (If you do stay here I hope you get to meet Mr. OmeletMan at least!)",0.138966218966219

Sheraton Suites Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,3.0,"Not the best Sheraton that I've stayed at, and only slightly better than average.  

The hotel offers a free shuttle that picks you up from the Airport.  Bonus points for that.

The furnishings were slightly abused and worn.  Not a deal breaker, but makes the place look a little run down.  The room was clean enough, but the carpet was looking a little shabby.

There was a nice new-ish HD television in the main area, and another HDTV in the bedroom.  Given the times we live in, this is about PAR for the course.

Free breakfast is offered at the top floor, which is good for the coffee and milk (if you have kids).  I think I saw some fruit, but I didn't have any.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,4.0,"Just enjoyed the 4th of July at this hotel and it was nothing short of amazing...after we got checked in.

We booked our room through the 1-800 central number, we requested to book a firework view room, were given the price and paid in full to guarantee it. 

Well when we arrived we were told it was a $200 upgrade fee for a firework view room. Turns out that central reservations booked us in a city view room and requested firework view in notes only. What we needed was a park view room. 

Long story short, I was at front desk over an hour speaking (on the phone, they didn't even come down to personally speak to me) to Managers Miriam (I think that's her name it started with an M) and Al who were both rude and un-accommodating. 

We are on a 24 day road trip only staying at Hilton properties(when available) and I am a Hilton Honors member. I am appalled at the lack of respect and the un-professionalism by both of them...Al especially. (Who supposedly is her supervisor.) I will be speaking with Hilton about this.

Al passed the buck and said the only way I was getting a firework view room at no addl. charge is if I speak to a manager at the call center and they do it. 

I was on the phone with them forever and the call center manager called Al directly. While I was on hold, the front desk manager finally had some mercy as my kids are saying they are hungry and why couldn't we get lunch, she told me to hang up and gave me a partial firework view room at the price I pre-paid. 

The room was beautiful, huge living room with full kitchen, balcony, king bed, fold out couch which kids slept on. Room view wasn't full firework view, we had to go on balcony and look to side but that was fine. 

The managers reception was amazing. Full bar with cocktails, wine, beer, and soda. (We got our money's worth both nights, it was unlimited for 2 hours) On the 4th they went BIG and did a whole kids station with cherry coke and Shirley temples, juice boxes and water. They had fresh baked pretzels, chips/salsa, veggies/ranch, and a candy bar with m&m's and sour patch kids! Amazing...and the managers walked around and greeted, they were so friendly!

I never did see Miriam or Al(thank goodness because I was going to tell them just how disrespected I felt.)

The breakfast was also amazing. Everything you could imagine, it was like being at a full service resturant brunch. It was served inside the attached TGI Fridays. 

All in all this was the perfect hotel to stay in for 4th of July in Philadelphia and had we been quoted $450 for a firework view room, we would have paid it and still felt it was a good value(considering the managers reception and full breakfast each day for a family of 4!)

Just one piece of advice, for this location always book through hotel directly, so you don't get the shady upsell charge at check in.",0.17267953929539293
Homewood Suites by Hilton Philadelphia-City Avenue,Philadelphia,4.0,"I stayed here two nights and I loved it. It was clean and had a mini kitchen and lots of space with a super big bed! :) It smelled a little bit like indian food, but it's nothing that an open window couldn't help.

It's conveniently located next to I think about 3 bus stops - the 44 takes you downtown to the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, Reading Terminal Market, Mutter Museum, etc. About a 20-30 minute ride.

There is parking outside the hotel on the street and we didn't have to fight for a spot either. If there aren't spaces there, there's a $5 parking lot down the street. There's free breakfast and dinner. It's not GREAT food, but it's decent enough if you're too lazy to go out and get something. There's a business center that's free for you to print and do other things. We also went swimming in the pool in the Hilton next door, which is connected on the second floor where the gym is too. The pool is chlorine filled, but a good time if you have nothing better to do.

If you don't know it's there behind a sports bar and Panera, you may totally miss it. The entrance and exiting procedure involves a little hike through the downhill/uphill driveway that transients like to hang-out in and smoke, eat your leftover doggy bags, urinate, etc. This place is SEVERELY dated and in need of not only updating but basic maintenance. For instance, our bathroom sink had a major CRACK. The grout in the mop board in the bathroom was rotted out, the ceiling fan rattled LOUDLY, and on and on. The service was also questionable.  One of the front desk ladies was rude.  The maid service was vastly diverse, despite our leaving a good tip every morning before leaving for work.

Where to start with this place.....Well we got there after having booked this place a few months in advance, not being a peak time, in between mardi gras and jazz fest.  When we called we made sure that we had nonsmoking and a king size bed, which at that time they told us no problem, blah blah blah.  so we get there and they give us our room, we go up to it and there are 2 beds, not one.  we thought this was lame, so i called down, got no answer, and then walked back down the elevator, went down 10 floors in a sketchy elevator.  I then walked up to the service person, told them what was up, and they said sorry, but there is nothing that they could do for us.  They said that since we are staying there for 6 nights, that there would be no reason why tomorrow we could not switch rooms and she would make sure it happened and pass it on.  We thought, oh well, guess we can hang in there for a night and deal with it tomorrow.  Well we got up in the morning and of course there was a new crew working.  when i asked the new lady if i could get a new room per the promise of the night crew the night prior, she rolled her eyes at me, and said there was no way to do it.  very very rude.  so here we are on a ""romantic getaway"" and we have seperate beds.  whatever, stinks, but we are adults and worked this out.

1. The bathroom was dirty. There was dried urine on the toilet, stains in the shower, hair (not mine), and a shower liner that stunk like mold.

2. The people working the front desk (all but the girl who initially checked me in) were rude. Any time you asked a question, a response was given like you were bothering them. On three occasions I tried calling the front desk and no one answered. 

3. They charge $31 per night to keep your car (compact size). To me, parking should be an integrated cost to the room. I booked on a travel site and was totally thrown off guard about this fee upon arrival which added an additional $62 to my trip that I was not anticipating.

A few people working here were lovely: couple of the bar tenders, the shuttle driver, and a couple of the front desk people. A couple of others were kind of dismissive/rude.

Here's what prompted me to write the review: I wanted to get a bottle of water before going up bed. There's no mini fridge in the room so I couldn't grab one there. Both of the vending machines on my floor turned out to be broken and when I went to the front desk to buy a $2 water, they were rude/dismissive.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"Very dissatisfied with this location. My father and his wife stayed there around mid-January to visit me after I had my baby. The HVAC system was broken as the noise was horrendous in their rooms, to compensate for that and other issues they were promised a 2 bedroom suite at a generous price on their next visit. They returned to visit for my father's birthday because my child is still too small to travel to them. They arrived and were informed that their reservation was cancelled because they ran my step-mother's credit card used to reserve the room (which was booked 2 weeks in advance) and it was declined. (Meanwhile, it was a bank decline because it was flagged as a suspicious charge from Philly.) She was never contacted and they cancelled her reservation while she was on her way to the hotel with no notice. When she asked why she was not notified she stated that pre-running the cards was policy and they don't have to notify the customer. When she asked to see proof of that policy in their handbook, no one could supply it. (Additionally, it just so happened that the hotel was overbooked and they were likely able to sell that room for 3x the price they promised my parents for their last bad experience.) The staff was very rude and condescending to her when she was trying to figure out where she was going to go with all of her bags in the middle of a snowstorm. They gave away her room without even bothering to re-run her card. The Hilton Honors rep we spoke to was mortified and even stated that the ""policy"" they touted was non-existent. I wish it was possible to give negative stars. My parents should have learned from their first bad experience instead of giving this hotel the chance to go from bad to worse!

1) rude rude rude.... the gals in the front and parking garage were just unbelievable rude - I hate my job- type attitude 

2) this hotel has no USB ports in the room.

3) parking is $30 a night.

4) they charged me an extra 40 dollars my second night, when my original reservation said the same rate for both nights. They refused to fix it on their end. 

5) the bar is dingy and gross. 

6) no early check in! Got there at 12 and was told my room wasn't ready... so I came back at 2:30- room still wasn't ready. Then I sat at the lobby with 5-6 other people waiting to check in.. and right at 3, everyone was able to check in.. I've never encountered that before- and I travel a lot

Sheraton Suites Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,1.0,"The second time I've booked this hotel.   The first time the experience was quite pleasant and the Concierge/ Front Desk Attendant was okay. HOWEVER, this past Friday night it was totally different! I actually created this Yelp account to complain about the experience I received! 

I arrived at the hotel at 2AM in the morning and spoke to the Front Desk attendant (Terria Williams) - I apologize for publishing her name, but I was really annoyed by her and I hope by identifying Ms. Williams maybe the Hotel would offer her a Customer Service rehabilitation/ remedial programme so she would not ill treat her next Hotel guests!   

Immediately after informing her that I am checking in and giving her my last name, I asked if I had access to the ""Club Lounge"" area because I had made the reservation on Hotels.com and they mentioned that the Club Suites do have access to the Lounge area.  Thereupon, I believe without looking properly at my room check-in details, she went on to say it's only available for SPG members and that I do not have access.  I told her about my Hotels.com reservation and upon hearing this, she immediately became rude, belligerent, patronizing and downright MEAN!

She told me not to get smart with her and that she would not offer me any rooms! I told her I had already prepaid for my room and simply wanted to know about the club access.  She had  a side conversation with a Security Guard who was standing by the side and said something to the effect of ""I can't stand these people and it's a full moon outside too"".  I don't understand what the relevance between having a civil conversation with an adult and the moon being outside means? Also her reference of ""these people"" came off as a subtle racist remark!  Even the Security Guard looked at me and shook his head as if to say ""Don't listen to what she has to say, just ignore her"".

I told her it's 2 AM in the morning and I would just like my room key now.  She just laid it on the table and didn't say anything else.  

If Management is reading this PLEASE make sure she gets reprimanded for her behaviour that night and if she's reading this PLEASE improve your Customer Service skills and the way you talk to Hotel Guests!!!!!

Best Western Plus St. Christopher Hotel,New Orleans,3.0,"Great location and reasonable pricing. The rooms are a bit small and don't have enough storage space but they're decorated tastefully. The air conditioning in the rooms is terrible and does not work. We stayed 5 nights and had the AC set to the lowest setting (50 degrees) and we're still unable to sleep with clothing or blankets. I broke a sweat each day just getting ready, which is abnormal for me. It sucks coming in from a long day of drinking in the heat and humidity and not being able to cool off, you're sweating again right after getting out of the shower. 

My biggest issue was the level of service. It baffles me how rudely we were treated by the front desk staff, including the manager (Christine or Chrystal maybe?). We were ignored in the lobby on multiple occasions. Once when we wanted to ask for directions, at check in, and check out. The staff is in no hurry to help you and will ignore you, even if you're the only one in the lobby, until they feel they're ready to help. When we checked out we had to leave our bags with the front desk before the flight. When we went to collect our items and head to the airport, only the manager was at the front desk and we were ignored in the lobby by the manager for 15 minutes while we waited for the gentleman to let us into the bag room. She did not offer to help us herself or page the bag gentleman, she was content letting us sit in the lobby ignored until he came back from wherever he was for 15 minutes. I will not return to this hotel because I do not like paying for terrible service. Avoid unless you want to be ignored.",-0.04548872180451129
Holiday Inn New Orleans-Downtown Superdome,New Orleans,1.0,"Well, to start we have been here for 2 weeks for work. Never again will I come to this hotel. The people are nice, for the most part. Other then a couple of the housekeeping ladies, completely rude to me, because I asked them to properly clean my shower. No exaggeration there is at least a month and a half of soap scum buildup in my shower. I have found a hair in my bed after I requested new sheets because of foreign stains that I'm not even sure what they were from( gross), as for the room service... The food is ok, if you don't mind flavorless food and possibly burnt pancakes in the am! After the first week I made it very clear to them that I would like my shower clean properly. Still hasn't happened. Personally went out and bought shower shoes, afraid of getting a fungus or something worse. I gave them two stars and that's an exaggeration!",0.04443001443001443
Sheraton Suites Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,1.0,"Don't waste your money! When we first arrived, it looked pretty nice and we liked our room. But after a day we realized that this place is actually a mess.
There were a lot of broken things in the room...a broken piece of cabinetry with nails sticking out that had just been propped up. Something was wrong with the shower handle, it was super loose and hard to use. Toliet had to be flushed three times instead of one. You get the picture.
When we went to eat at their bistro, there was a ton of flies, stains on chairs, wobbly tables, etc. the food was ok.
While I realize that it's not totally the hotel's fault, I've never stayed somewhere that had so much noise in the middle of the night. Door slamming, stomping in the halls, loud talking. At 1:00am, there was drunk screaming from downstairs. It has sounded like the people next door were either moving or throwing furniture all night (it's almost 6am). 
Their wifi policy also sucks. You only get free wifi in the tiny lobby and computer area. anywhere else you have to pay for it. Never been at a hotel like that, and it's pretty annoying.
The front desk people were constantly on personal calls and incredibly rude when they weren't.
When we checked in, we walked by a pile of puke outside a room door. When we checked out, it was still there. I think that tells you everything you need to know.
We're about to go check out and I can't wait to get the eff out of here.",-0.01822344322344323
Hyatt Regency Indianapolis,Indianapolis,5.0,"The Hyatt is a very clean hotel with a really great staff. The receptionist, Dalton, was the most helpful employee I've ever experienced at a hotel. I will always appreciate how much he went out of his way to make my stay more enjoyable. The rooms are kind of hot but if you call the front desk they will send someone up to fix it. The beds are pretty comfortable and the pillows are AMAZING! Wish I could have taken one home. As long as you know where all the elevators are, the wait really isn't that long. My only complaint would be the gift shop, and bar. The gift shop because they guy running it is always extremely annoyed that he has to help paying costumers. The two times I went in there he was on his phone and was really disrespectful to all of the people entering his store. The bar really depends on your bar tender, but they spend most of their time talking and flirting with one another instead of actually helping people. I had to hold up my empty drink, or grab someone walking in to get another. All in all it was a great stay. The front desk will answer any questions and help you with all needed shuttles/rides/directions. It's always super clean and comfortable seating in the lobby with charging stations. Would definitely recommend.",0.2902380952380953
Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"Part 1- I made the Manager aware that not only was I going to write multiple reviews on my hotel stay, but that I will also write a formal letter to Hilton's corporate headquarters as well.  There is a reason that this hotel is so much cheaper than all of the other hotels in the area; not only is the staff ridiculously rude, but the property has many flaws as well.
When you check into the hotel, be prepared for a wait.  At peak check in time, after work hours on a Friday, I waited about 20 minutes to get to a front desk agent.  When I finally got to an agent, they could not see my name in the system.  Now, in the hotels defense, my husband did make the reservations, HOWEVER, my husband took the extra time to add my name to the reservation, because we were not traveling together.  Unfortunately, there is a flaw in THEIR system, when a person adds a name to the reservation, Embassy suites 800 reservation line can see the added name, but the hotel cannot.  So the system does not transfer all of the information from the online reservation to the actual hotel that you are staying at.  The craziest part about this FLAW in THEIR system, is that I called to confirm that my name was indeed on the reservation, along with my husbands, days prior to checking in.  After speaking to the manager, ""they did me a favor,"" which I was told several times throughout my stay by a cocky night manager (female- You're ONLY a hotel manager...), and checked me into the room.  Again, in their defense... FLAW in the system, to which someone higher up the chain is probably responsible for fixing.  Why would the systems (online reservations, the actual hotel system, and the 800 reservation line) not coincide with one another??  I'm a woman of progress... it's a flaw in YOUR system, not the customers problem... fix it!  At the very least, call the 800 # to confirm; they would not do this, as it was not their policy.  God forbid they use the time that they are getting paid to dial their main reservation 800 number in order to check-in a guest, which they are inconveniencing.
I get to my room, and it reeked of potent marijuana smell, by that time, after a 12 hour travel day, I simply laid down and took a nap.  I left the patio door open, in hopes of airing out of the room.  I was awakened by my husband who finally got to the room about an hour later and we went out for dinner.  We had reservations and were pressed for time, the room had aired out pretty well, so rather than make another complaint, and we simply went to dinner.  When we returned, I suppose the group above us had begun smoking marijuana again; I went downstairs and told the desk there was a potent weed smell in our room.  I have allergies, my husband is asthmatic.  They offered for us to switch rooms, but I declined; knowing that my husband had already changed over and would be asleep by the time I returned to the room.  The hotel attendant also mentioned several times ""Well, it's a smoking floor above you so...""   I was confused by her statement, so it's a smoking floor, so they're allowed to smoke weed?  I was in disbelief that she was that dense.  Also!; They ought to tell families if they are putting them immediately beneath the smoking floors; All of the ventilation systems are connected, so clearly the closer you are to the smoking floors, the more potent smoke smell will be, no matter what kind (weed, cigarettes).  It should be mentioned as a common courtesy to their guests, so that at that time, as they are checking in they have a chance to switch rooms.  I DON'T want to smell smoke, and as a nonsmoker I should have the choice not to!  As I was talking to the front desk attendant, security came over and was listening to my gripe; I finished, there was not resolution, so I simply walked to the elevator to wait to go up (The elevators are a nightmare, they only have 3 of them, 1 of them was not even working, and you can easily be waiting 10 minutes for 1, because they are so small).  As I was waiting for my elevator the security guard and front desk attendant looked over at me and he started chuckling, so I went back over and asked, ""Do you think my complaint is funny?; Is it funny to you that I have to smell weed all night? I want to see a manager.""  The manager came out, (the one who made it her business to tell me that they did me a courtesy by checking me into my hotel earlier) and asked what happened.  As I was talking to her, the front desk attendant chimes in and says ""we weren't laughing at her"", to which my reply was Bulls*it.  So naturally the manager at that point wanted to make the whole conversation about me saying the word BS, rather than the weed smoking nonsense, disrespectful security guard.  I simply told her, ""You get what you give in this world.""  His response was to laugh at my complaint and be disrespectful, and the hotel attendant's response was to interrupt as I was talking to a manager, and my response was to call it like I see it .... BS!",0.05562610229276898

Courtyard by Marriott Edmonton West,Edmonton,3.0,"I've debated doing this review for a while.  As an organizer for my high school's 10 year reunion, we chose the Marriott Courtyard West for it's location and facilities, and it's a beautiful building.  The original event planner I worked with was great, Meganne, and she was really helpful and understanding that we were working with a tight budget in order to make the event affordable for all of our classmates to attend, regardless of their financial status.  However, she was not there the night of the event.  There was another rep assigned to work with us and I felt that we were super unwelcome, which I get as we were a bunch of 28-30 year olds who hadn't seen each other in 10 years, but the hotel knew the type of event going in - a reunion with a fundraising aspect to it.  Simple things that had been pre-planned with Meganne weren't followed through, like the lighting, which was supposed to be dimmed and I couldn't get them to assist me with that.  The original contract stated that we had the venue til 1am, with the bar shutting down at midnight.  The intent was to allow people to enjoy their last drink(s) and say their goodbyes.  However, at midnight when the bar closed, the hotel essentially kicked us out and I couldn't find the rep to speak to about it; by the time I did, people were already heading out.  As we were packing up, it looked as though they were needing our room for an event the next day.  

I wouldn't plan an event there again, unless it was a conference or a dinner, if there might be extra noise and/or music as we were asked to keep the noise down starting at about 10pm so there was a lot (A LOT) of talking and music playing at a moderate level in the background. 

That being said, the venue & facilities were clean & fashionable, the food was great and the guest rooms were fabulous. We received a special rate for anyone attending the event who needed a guest room.",0.1880984126984127
Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"After a very late Mega Bus trip in from NYC, I arrived to the hotel to be greeted by the most rude hotel employee I have ever encountered. She asked me for my ID and credit card, after fumbling for a minute I found my passport and couldn't locate my credit card valet. I was freaking out and asked her if she could take cash or charge the card on file. She told me she had to have the credit card (understandable) and that she did not take cash. I stepped away for a moment and phoned my friend who located my credit card valet 2 hours away in NYC. After visions of me sleeping on a park bench in Philly pranced through my head, she told me that she could take the cash with a deposit. That was just fine with me. I totally understood that. But the check in process was painful, then she kept saying things to me about having to take cash and how it annoyed her. 

The breakfast was sub par for an Embassy. The bar items were cold and the omlette was on the greasy side. 

The day hotel staff was much more friendly. However, the front desk clerk gave walking directions through a rather shady part of town. 

The location is great. The rooms are roomy. It was only a 10 dollar ride to the airport via shuttle bus, only 3 more dollars than the train from a 1970's horror movie.

It wasn't a horrible stay. I would just avoid checking in late with old 
nurse Hatchett.

I have been staying at hilton properties for about 10 years. This embassy suites is by far the worst hotel i have ever been to. This place should be shut down. Be aware do not stay there. The staff from a greeter to a manager are rude and do not care. The property is falling apart. I was checked in to a room with black mold all over the ceiling and on the edges of walls. On day 3, portion of the ceiling actually started falling down on the floor. The next room I was checked in, hasn't been serviced and was dirty. It  also had a leaking shower and dismanteled shower head. The room was missing hairdryer and the iron didn't work, let me tell you it was a project to get these items from the front desk- it took them 1.5 hour to deliver a hairdryer to my room :) The elevator system is a joke and one day I had to walk down and climb back from the 27th floor because it was broken. The MOD offered not to charge me for the nights I spent in the moldy room and told me that they will give me some HH recovery points. None of these promises happened. I was charged a full amount and for 3 weeks now I am trying to get refunded. I tried to get ahold of the GM and was told that Steve McClure (the GM) quit and walked out. I emailed next person in charge- the Director of the rooms- Ricardo Arrington and haven't heard back from him.

For a hotel to have the rudest staff I have ever met is extremely disheartening and disappointing. It feels that no one really cares about anything here. They ignore questions and comments and give dirty looks for any question you may have. When traveling to a new place it is nice and much appreciated to have accommodating people. This was not the case here. For an extra 50 bucks a night we could have been at ANY OTHER HOTEL that actually cares. That was to inform everyone that no, it was not extremely cheap but everything about this location has been cheapened. I work in the service industry which absolutely makes this worse.

Last year unfortunately will be my last. This year I booked a nicer place. On the positive side, I enjoy the managers reception and the large breakfast. However, it was very dirty. Hair in the shower etc. we had 2 adults and 4 teenagers in one room. The room was only stocked with 1/2 a roll of toilet paper. It took them 3 hours to bring more. The kids and I, upon waking up had to go 12 floors down in our pajamas to use the bathroom at the pool. The staff was rude at best. The only exception was the maintenance man. He was a class act. He had to unlock and change the temperature in our room. We were on the 14th floor in July and they had our room locked in at 76 degrees! It was very smelly and stuffy. Especially with all 6 of us. The service was not very good. The hotel was under construction and there was dust flying around. Our room was a newly updated one and beware of the new bathroom doors.

Home2 Suites by Hilton Indianapolis Northwest,Indianapolis,1.0,"Do not stay here, we just had a horrible experience with this hotel and staff, especially the GM Phillip. Within the first few minutes we were there my son, who is 17, got stuck in their elevator until the fire dept got him out 30 minutes later. The manager ran off after and when I asked to talk to him he blamed my son saying ""last time this happened there were kids jumping up and down and pushing buttons"". So no apology, just blame. And I am sure my son was not doing those things, he is not a little kid. 

There were numerous other problems with this place such as housekeeping leaving a friends room open all day and as far as when a friend noticed a fire in their mulch, the front desk staff offered her 2 bottles of water for HER to put it out. The staff were extremely rude. 

To top it off, the manager eventually said he would take money off our bill for the elevator incident as he did shots with us on the patio. He did not!! We had to ask at check out and he told the person helping us to give us a very small discount. It's not about the money, it's about the fact there was not apology and only blame.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Philadelphia-City Avenue,Philadelphia,3.0,"I had an extended stay at this hotel for about a week and a half. In all, it was OK but I was a bit disappointed, especially for the cost. The front desk staff was friendly enough, and my room was OK (but just OK). It did feel a little like you were in a cheaper hotel than a Hitlon-owned property. So here's the good, the bad and the ugly.

First of all, do not be confused. The Homewood Suites is next to the Hilton. You can't really see it from the road when you first turn. It is conveniently located near a number of restaurants and retail stores. I liked the convenience of things since I was staying so long. But it is in a pretty traffic-heavy area of the city and not the easiest to navigate, so beware. Unfortunately, I did feel a bit like a second-class citizen. The Hilton is clearly a much better maintained property. Things at the Homewood seemed dated and just slightly not kept up properly. I particularly disliked that you had to take a bit of a walk through a connecting tunnel to get to the pool or the fitness center, which were in the Hilton and not the Homewood.

Second, the thing I hated the most about my stay was the parking situation. At first, I figured I'd valet park. But I accidentally pulled into the Hilton instead of the Homewood Suites. Once we figured out that I belonged next door, the sky captain was kind enough and very patient while he walked me over to the Homewood and waited for me to check in. But that was the extend of my good experiences parking. They have this weird text message system for the valet here. I was told to text to get my car. The person took my car to the Hilton and had to be paged back to the Homewood. Then she told me curtly that I should specify that I'm at the Homewood. I gave up and decided to self park, which is a bit of a pain. You have to remember to get your ticket validated each time you want to leave, and the parking lot is a bit of a hike. On my final night, a valet employee stopped to yell at us that we were parking in the wrong part of the very expansive parking lot. No one told us there were designated areas and we were there for a week and a half. The parking attendants with the exception of that bell captain were all rude and bossy.

My room itself was fine, though again, it felt a bit dated in furniture and style. The bed was comfortable at least. It had a small kitchenette with a full sized fridge, which was great. But there were some things that made no sense. I had plates, cups, glasses and mugs but no silverware. The desk had absolutely no paper anywhere - no little notepad, no envelope. I had to go buy a notebook. And the TV had some sort of weird thing going on with it where every time I turned it off with the remote, the next day I couldn't get the cable signal back without calling maintenance. On day four they finally replaced the TV in my room, after which it was fine.

The front desk staff was a highlight. They were all very nice and answered all of my questions.

Would I stay here again? Maybe but probably not. I would book elsewhere or at the Hilton.",0.05516812865497074
Holiday Inn New Orleans-Downtown Superdome,New Orleans,2.0,"So I'm used to travel involving a little discomfort and annoyance on my part. Hotel beds tend to be firmer than I like, for example - but that's the industry standard. I don't hold it against individual hotels, and I know what I'm getting into when I hit the road. This time though, my problems are pretty much all with the staff. During my stay here, they struck me (and my mother, who was traveling with me) as everything from forgetful to downright rude.

Our hotel room itself was perfectly fine - in fact it was a great place to recharge after our daily adventures in New Orleans. We had plenty of room to spread out; we opened our balcony door almost every night to enjoy the great breeze; and we thought it was hilarious that two people from Pittsburgh were placed in a room with Andy Warhol artwork. I wanted to take advantage of the outdoor pool, but sadly never had the time or energy. By the way, they have an outdoor pool!

The hotel overall was also lovely - it has great colors, a welcoming and relaxing lobby, and elevators that never kept us waiting very long (and we were on the 18th floor). The bar and restaurant was understaffed one night, but the food was great (I recommend the fish tacos), the drinks were strong, and the lone woman holding down the fort did a fabulous job all things considered.

That unfortunately is where my praise ends, as my mother and I experienced major problems with housekeeping throughout the week. One day they didn't bother restocking our toilet paper, so we had to call the front desk at 9pm or so to ask for more. Then we had to call AGAIN 30 minutes after the initial call, and were hung up on during that second call... Fortunately, after the third call, the issue was resolved.

Another day, we came back after a long day out to discover that housekeeping didn't touch our room at ALL. The beds weren't made, the dirty towels were still on the bathroom floor...when we complained, the hotel said they could send someone up to clean the room at that time. Keep in mind, it was late, and we were tired, and I think we were cold and damp because it was storming that day. The last thing we wanted was for housekeeping to come into our room that late, doing something that should have been taken care of hours ago. Nothing else was done or offered to make up for housekeeping skipping our room that day.

Finally, we got to the day of check-out, and we discovered that a $20 charge for a movie was added to our hotel bill! Long story short (because oh man, is it a long story), my mother went back and forth with the hotel staff throughout the day, both in person AND on the phone at the airport. The staff said the movie was played in its entirety, that they checked security tapes and we were in the room when it was played, and therefore nothing could be done about the charge. Here's the thing - my mother and I never touched the TV remote in our room once during our visit. She had books, and I had an iPad (which I managed to get to work even though the wi-fi in our room was, frankly, spotty at best). And we were in New Orleans for a week. This is not the kind of city to visit if you're pinching pennies. If we had watched the movie, we would have been happy to pay for it.

Eventually, through social media and email exchanges, we were able to contact Holiday Inn as a whole and get the movie removed from the bill. But that was it. Nothing was ever done to address the housekeeping issues (which I also mentioned in my feedback), and no one ever figured out why the hotel's system said we watched an entire movie when our TV was never even on. Since the staff didn't seem to believe us, we're not even sure that this issue will be resolved for future guests.

If I'm lucky enough to return to New Orleans, this hotel will absolutely not be involved in my plans. My two stars are strictly for the nice rooms - everything else was a one star experience. My mother has actually sworn off Holiday Inn in its entirety after this visit. I have not; but I will certainly be extra vigilant about all my hotel bills in the near future after this experience.",0.14367216945575156

The hotel itself is great but the shuttle driver needs to be taught what her job is!!   We had a 6:15 am flight. We went downstairs around 5, the shuttle was parked outside so we got into it. The shuttle driver was at the front desk talking to the clerk. We sat and sat and sat. Finally we got out and said something to her like umm we have a flight we need to get to. She acted like WE were being the rude ones disturbing her!!! She moseys out to the shuttle and we leave. She seems to be taking a while to get to the airport, like she's doing it on purpose to make us late. We look at our map on our phone and wonder what the hell is she doing?! When we finally get there it's too late, we get booked on a later flight. We call the hotel and ask if the shuttle can come back, they say yes its on the way. We wait for about 30 or so then call again. The clerk says well you have to call for the shuttle. WHAT?!! We did call you?! So we wait a tad longer and still no shuttle. We finally get a cab and ask the clerk at the hotel if the hotel will cover it because we've been sitting here for an hour waiting for the shuttle! She says yes. So we go back to the hotel and try to relax. The shuttle gets us to the airport in time later that day.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"Annotated reasons why you should not book at the Embassy Suites - Center City Philadelphia, as experienced by my recent stay: 

1. Our hotel room was not clean upon our arrival. There were remnants of our previous guest scattered throughout the room
2. During our 4 night stay, our room was only ""properly cleaned"" twice
3. My brand new Macbook laptop and my colleague's Macbook charger was stolen
4. My colleague was charged for overnight parking during the stay. We flew to Philadelphia and did not have a car with her.
--------
I recently stayed at this hotel for four night for a conference nearby. There were a total of four of us, staying in two separate rooms for said conference. 

1. During our first night in the room, my colleague grabbed the ice bucket to fill it up with ice and found jello shots from the previous guests at the bottom of ice bucket. She immediately reported the event to the front desk. They apologized and assured her that it would be cleaned. The next day, when returned from our conference sessions, not only did we find that the jello shot at the bottom of the ice bucket had not been removed, but we also found additional items in the fridge. She, once again, reported the items to the front desk and and the manager on site. The objects were finally removed before our third night. However, when we were packing to leave, my colleague found two empty jello shot containers underneath her bed. 
2. In addition to the negligent cleaning performed the hotel staff prior to our arrival, our room was only fully cleaned twice during our 4 night stay. Our room was completely skipped on night,and another they cleaned and removed the used towels, but failed to replace them.
3. The fact that my almost $2,000 dollars worth of technology was stolen from a room that I paid to be secure is unacceptable. While I will not go into full detail, the fact remains that I entered this hotel with my laptop to use for onsite work and networking, and I left the hotel room without one due to their disrespectful, violating staff. Because their insurance company, Liberty Mutual, was unable to find evidence of ""negligence and liability"", my stolen laptop will not be replaced. And from reading previous reviews, my theft is not the first one that occurred on this property recently. 
4. My group is based out of North Carolina, so we all flew to Philadelphia and use Lyft/Uber for all of our transportation. Therefore, it was interesting that she was charged for four nights of overnight parking. She did not have a car on site. 

This stay certainly ranks as one of the worse hotel stays I have ever experienced. While the staff was tolerable, the accommodations and amenities were subpar. I would have been willing to look over the cleanliness lapses and charges, but the theft is not something to be taken lightly. And apparently, my theft was not the sole story from this facility. There are some serious issues regarding communication, cleanliness and security at the Embassy Suites - Philadelphia Center City. Do not book this hotel.",0.04897456709956709

Hilton Garden Inn Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"This Hilton hotel does not live up to its Hilton Guarantee !!

Sunday, I arrived at 11:30am and asked for Early Check-in, they advised the hotel was sold out the evening before and early check-in was not available.  The representative put me on a waiting list in case anything became available before check-in time.  I left my belongings and did some sight-seeing.  Returned at approximately 2:30pm; I asked if there my reservation was ready, the same representative assigned me a room, different from what I had originally requested.  I originally request 10th floor and she gave me 9th floor because the room I requested was not ready yet.  I asked if I wait the remaining 25 minutes, will my room be ready, she said she cannot guarantee it, most likely not.  I said well, go ahead and book me.  She then charged the full amount of the room, plus deposit and taxes all in one swoop.  I complained about this room fiasco on the mobile app and they stood by their ""we can only guarantee a reservation at 3pm"" basically too bad, so sad.   I also had requested an upgrade package from their ""Drinks and Snacks"" in my room and it was completely ignored when asked on the mobile site two times. 

Monday morning, I leave my room at 8:00am and return at 3:00pm, I was running late and left shirt sale tags on the floor along with my towels from the shower.  I returned at 3pm and my room had not been cleaned or refilled.  I mentioned it on the online mobile app, and they said, sorry, we will address it.  I left on Tuesday morning at 7:45am and returned at 3:00pm and the room was not cleaned.  I left another message and someone contacts me to address the concern.  I declined them to come by since I was going to stay in the hotel and I didn't want them to come by when I was in the room.

I get a call from Tania late Tuesday afternoon, the Front Desk leader and was asked how can if they can give me a few additional bonus points or have some dinner on them ... I said, no thank you, I gave up on attempting to make this a pleasant experience with the several missed opportunities. 

I had not ever experienced such disregard to customer service at a Hilton chain hotel.  All they could say is sorry for the inconvenience and we take take your comments to address to our team so it doesn't happen again ... This hotel was an overflow hotel for a conference at about $270 a night ... plus applicable taxes and fees.

Hyatt Regency Indianapolis,Indianapolis,1.0,Stayed at this hotel for my layover as an airline crew member. Hotel is ok. Staff seems too busy to deal with guests checking in or out. Went upstairs to the Eagle's Nest Restaurant at 7:00pm on a Wednesday night to see if it was a place I could enjoy a nice dinner. It was not busy so the staff could not have been stressed or overworked. I was met by an extremely rude and unprofessional hostess. I told her I was a guest in the hotel and would like to just look in to the restaurant to see it. The restaurant is not visible from the hostess stand since it is right in the elevator area. She told me that I was not allowed to look into the restaurant as per her managers orders. I have never heard anything like this before. If this is how the staff is trained by the restaurant management they must be desperate for employees who have no common sense or customer service feeling.

When we travel here from SC we have always stayed here since the hotel is conveniently located right next-door to his job and is centrally located to everything. The front desk people are extremely helpful and nice along with the people that work the front door. The hotel offers a nice complementary breakfast each day at TGI Friday's and a complementary happy hour from 5:30 to 7:30 PM with a nice variety of drink options every day in the lobby along with light snacks.

This place would for sure be a 5/5 stars if it wasn't for the rude African American bar manager that seems to be working most days when we visit the hotel. For no reason at all, he is extremely rude to us and other guest. I have a hard time believing that others have not complained about his rude attitude towards the guest. There are many others who visit here from my husbands employer who have started staying elsewhere because of his rudeness.

For me she didn't even make an effort to let me know what amenities would I be able to use during my 6 day stay in this place instead she made me feel offended when I wanted just a clarification for the charges regarding the same.

Home2 Suites by Hilton Indianapolis Northwest,Indianapolis,1.0,"My friends and I bought a room online and checked in the next day, but the manager refused service before handing us the key because he said we ""looked like we were having a party"". All we asked was can we have an extra person be in the room and leave later since no more than 4 people could sleep in the room. He kept saying no parties. And then he told the front desk later to put us in a room on the first floor so they could watch us and make sure we're not sneaking extra people in. He said ""how will I know if you're sneaking people in or not?"" We said, ""We wouldn't be because we don't wanna get kicked out and waste our money"". We then asked, ""Since we can't have that extra person, would we be able to cancel and get a refund?"" He got frustrated with us asking so many questions and told the front desk lady to cancel the room right after we checked in and paid a $25 fee for damage deposit. He said, ""I have the right to refuse you service. I'm gonna have to ask you all to leave"". We said ""We were just asking questions and we never wanted to cancel it, we were just trying to understand the whole situation"" because he was Indian and we couldn't really understand him and he probably couldn't understand us because he wasn't really answering our questions. The rooms are non refundable and he cancelled it without us even getting into the room. All because we asked questions. The manager had horrible customer service and I believe because of all the looting and rioting and what not going on, he racially discriminated against us because we were black and he seen us as a threat when our intentions of using the room was completely innocent.

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"I've stayed here every time I've ever come to Philadelphia, not because of the location or spacious rooms but because the first time I was here the staff was amazing!!! Sadly much has changed since then!!! 

The rooms were your standard hotel room but they've upgraded and now they are very modern and clean....this is why the two stars otherwise it would be no stars. 

I came for the NFL draft which I knew would make the hotel ultra busy and I was right. Since I have the Hilton app I checked in online. I arrived at the hotel at 12:30pm, several hours before the 4pm check in time. I didn't mind waiting for my room, what I did mind was the rudeness of the front desk lady. I was completely dismissed and talked to like I was an idiot when I simply asked if there was any chance I could fully check in even though I told her I knew it was an extremely long shot. I then handed my bags over to the bellman and took my claim ticket. I left to grab lunch. Upon arriving back at the hotel I took a seat in the lobby with the 30 other people waiting to check in. As I waited I saw more and more people get the keys to their room. When I finally went back up to the desk to inquire about my room I was told it wasn't ready, this was at 3pm. I went and sat back down just as my app alerted me my digital key was ready. I went to the bellman to retrieve my bags. I was brought out my two small bags but my larger bag was not found. After 20 mins of searching they realized it had a different ticket number of which I wasn't given. The only reason I received my bag was because it still had my information on the tag from the airline. 

After the checking in fiasco the next day was easy going except for the horrible smell of cigarettes of which I am allergic. When housekeeping cleaned my room however they took my washcloths, including the one I had hanging up, and wasn't given freash ones. Thankfully I have my own sea sponge. 

On my third day here, and on day three of a migraine due to the smoke from other rooms, I complained to the front desk about the smell. I was told there was nothing they could do. Mind you the smell wasn't outside on my balcony but only in my room coming from the hallway area, leading me to believe someone was chain smoking in their room. 

Sadly I won't be returning which is sad because I love the location but the staff has made it clear loyalty means nothing anymore! And FYI I've been a Hilton diamond member for YEARS!",0.03593876891842009

Embassy Suites by Hilton Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,2.0,"So, I came to this hotel for Made in America weekend and I wish we picked a different hotel.

First of all, the line to valet your car was horrendous. We were sitting in the ""driveway"" of the valet line for at least 10 minutes. I had to get out of my car to ask someone to valet my car. (note: the people who valet your car are wearing casual clothes, so you have no idea who actual works at the hotel).

After the valet mess, we finally get in the long check in line, which is pretty inefficient. It's 2017, why can't we check in from an app? After waiting 20 min in this line, we get our rooms keys. The room itself, was okay. Our toilet or shower flooded...I am not even sure but there was tons of water on the ground after each shower use.

Also, the hotel staff was really awful. I remember coming back from the festival, and trying to use the bathroom on the first floor. The man working at the hotel basically harassed me for a wristband and told me I was ""making his job difficult"", I am not sure what's so challenging about unlocking a bathroom door? I also asked the front desk receptionist if I could purchase a bottle of water. He rudely told me they were fixing the floor and he was unable to get water. I just think that's such poor customer service. Why would they have floor issues during a busy music festival? Seems like poor management...

The complimentary breakfast was gross and unpleasant.

Anyways, I will never stay at this hotel again. Just an overall bad experience.

Courtyard by Marriott Philadelphia Airport,Philadelphia,1.0,"I would give this hotel 0 stars if possible. 

We stayed one night from August 3rd-4th. During the night of August 3rd-4th I woke up itchy several times. I felt like things were crawling on me but since my husband who was sleeping next to me didn't seem to feel anything I thought it was just me or the sheets. When I awoke in the morning to my horror I had dozens of bites on my body. 

Immediately, my husband suspected bed bugs and lifted up the sheets to find prior blood speck stains on the mattress. We contacted the concierge who connected us with Patty the housekeeping manager. Patty sent a technician up to examine the bed. The technician would not rule out that there were bed bugs because he felt the blood specks on the mattress looked fresher than we initially thought. We checked beds in both rooms and found the same blood stain specks on both mattresses. We had to contain the stuffed animal which I slept with and the clothing which we wore in plastic bags.

After arriving home I proceeded to unpack the items (stuffed animal, shirt, shorts, undergarments from previous night) to be washed in the laundry and that's when our suspicions were confirmed. I found a small bed bug on the clothing and have contained it in a plastic medicine bottle.

Not only was my stay horrible because of the experience with the bed bugs, but the hotel's general manager was rude.

Hilton Garden Inn Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,1.0,"I downloaded the Yelp app on my phone to specifically give this review. I have NEVER encountered such a lack of customer service. I travel every year and have stayed in countless hotels. Yet I've never witness such a disconnect from pleasing the customer. Upon arriving to the hotel my husband was met with an unprofessional desk clerk and accommodations that we hadn't reserved. We just got married and requested a king size bed but was put into a double room with absolutely no resolve. Even after my sister talked to management nothing could be done, nor was any compensation offered. Moreover, we woke up to loud noises and banging due to construction that we were not notified about. When me husband called down to the front desk we were told ""sorry for not letting you know earlier but there's no compensation that can be given!"" As a frequent traveler, you encounter situations that are beyond managements control. However, a business that cares about their customers compensate you for what's in their control. This hotel has no qualms about telling their customers no and not following up with any sort of compensation to ease the customers let downs. The saddest part of this stay is this hotel is situated in a prime location which is very accessible to city life.  The best part of our stay-cation was when we weren't in the hotel. We were able to walk to Redding Terminal for lunch and just experience down town. It's extremely unfortunate that I would NEVER recommend this hotel to anyone. I have never felt so underserved and ignored in a hotel before. Despite its prime location, this hotel is a -1 for me. You would also like to think that if the service is bad the rooms are amazing. The rooms are a let down as well. The rooms are  not modernized and the beds are uncomfortable. We were also told that because we have a comped reservation that we couldn't be moved to another room. We were given our stay as a wedding gift. I found that comment to be very rude and revealed that staff had no intention of even treating us like a regular customer.

Went up to our room and after 20 minutes of trying to get the internet I called down and she stated you have to put your last name in I stated I'm putting it in. Your last name is XXXXX stated I know my last name she then said put it in. I stated again its not working next thing I had hold music and not one came back I had to call again and then in the middle of me asking hold music again and then ended up with internet support outside service. The room itself was ok looked new but the they are not cleaning for COVID the phone I had to use had so much dust on it you can tell had not been used in a while. I went to the bathroom swiped my hand across the counter dust everywhere. She sheets had a yellow tint to it. I will not be back.

Holiday Inn New Orleans-Downtown Superdome,New Orleans,1.0,"Right from the start our visit at this hotel was HORRIBLE. To start they tried to charge an extra $200 onto the rooms we had booked about a month ago, (tried to pay for then, but we're told to wait upon arrival) and price guaranteed. After being just plain insulted by 2 people at the front desk, and 40 minutes later they finally agreed to charge the set price. Then we come to find out they ignored our early check-in request (set a week in advance) for one of our two rooms... not a big deal but wait for the big picture. And they also ignored our request for conjoining rooms, again... big picture... finally get both of the rooms and come to realize one is a conjoining room to the room next to it, which is empty the entire stay. Second day we were going to the pool and asked a housekeeper what floor to go to and was told ""figure it the f**k out"" and had the door slammed in my face. Went to the lobby and overheard the manager yelling at a guest who was trying to ask an address of a certain place ""just come here already. Here. Come here."" Come back to the rooms one rooms ac went out. Stayed out until the next NIGHT. So from Monday 2pm to about Wednesday 6pm. No reason, just ignored our requests. Then we found the wallpaper had started to peel in the corner and the wall was just covered in mold. Called the front desk, were never called back nor had anyone sent up. Called back twice and nothing was done. We go to check out and the GM happened to be there and we kindly talked about everything and that we were very unhappy. As a manager ourself not looking for our money back or anything just hoping they would fix their problems, and we're told we'd be given one nights stay back. GM gets pulled into a meeting says to check with Genesis at the front desk who proceeded to argue about giving our money back. After about 40 minutes just left. So NOTHING about our stay was correct or even enjoyable. I WILL be back to NOLA but there is NO WAY we'd ever stay at this hotel ever again.",-0.014081632653061227
Courtyard Marriott,Indianapolis,2.0,"I travel a lot. This stay has been the most disappointing. I will not be booking this hotel again. Basic maintenance and cleanliness is not happening, as in walking down the hall to my room the carpet has debris on it. The tile in the elevator was dirty, needs deep cleaned. I can get over that sure. My hotel room is ok. Floor needed vacuumed, but again I can live with that.
My second night in, my toilet overflowed, from basic use. Just flushing. I called the front desk, she said ""I'll be right up"" 7 mins go by....... nothing........ I fixed the toilet myself.... the piece in the back got stuck making it continue to run..... needless to say I needed towels to clean up the water from the over flow (there was a lot)! 
I left my room go to the elevator to go to front desk, it stops on the 2nd floor.... the person who was at the desk gets on the elevator and I asked ""are you looking for my room?"" She said ""I got these rags, I was looking for a plunger"" (she was not rude). I told her I fixed the problem and we need towels because there was a lot of water, SHE HANDED ME THE RAGS AND I SAID OK TURNED AND WALKED AWAY SHAKING MY HEAD..... THE RAGS WERE OLD WASHCLOTHS!!! Really....... I sprinkle them over the flooded water..... then used the rest of the towels in my room to fully clean up the water....
Fast forward 2 nights, I get off work and go into the hotel, get on the elevator and notice the sign that says ""if you are in common areas you must wear a mask""...... ok 
I walk back down after changing to go eat the manager looks at me and says ""excuse me you need to wear a mask is you are down here"", (she was also not rude), I was slightly impatient, ""I am leaving and not staying in this are, no I'm good."" She said ""it's policy"", I said ""it's my last night I'm good"", so then I asked for a large trash bag for all of the toilet water towels, because I will not wear to go and ask for a trash bag later, I told her why and she questioned me as if I was lying to her...... ""this is the first I'm hearing about it"" ""when was it?"" All while changing her body language and facial expression to me........the girl that was there that night was there.... I said ""She's the one that was here"" the girl from the night.... 
they gave me a trash bag I put all the nasty towels in it.... 

I don't know what happened while I was at work, but 4 rooms doors were open and a 5th rooms door handle was completely missing... but that's none of my business....

To the point I called and spoke with corporates service line and they didn't really seem to care as well.

BE CAREFUL! THEY STEAL YOUR MONEY! NOT A SAFE HOTEL! 

We did not get the room cleaned in our stay

It was a huge fight  between the housekeeping memebers screaming loudly outside the room guests without any consideration and ethics. It was in the morning! How awful to wake up with those Screamings. I have never seen a fight like that.. Awful 
911 had to arrive later.

Housekeeping did a mess by drop coffee and cups. So after the check out my family and me were accused of that and also of scratch the walls and also accused for dropping the towels on the floor (that is the Only thing we did)

Did housekeeping did those scratches and drop the coffe to accuse us for revenge as we complaint about that we did no get the housekeeping service? Or Maybe they thought i  accused us about the fight as i got out of my room to take breakfast and they were all there in front of me.

Or did the scratches were from other guest who had a kid and accused us... Adding the coffee on the floor in purpose? 

I dont know why they did that but they charge 500 dollars. 
In the beginning was 250 but after we complaint to the general manager she added 250 more... 

The manager assistant was extremely rude. When we arrived so confused and worried of why that happened he treated us so bad threatening us to call the POLICE. My parents who are senior were also threatened. My dad has a heart condition and my Mother hypertense. It was Only ny wrote making the complaint and the rest of us in silence. 
We had to leave becauase we did not want to frustate more my parents in such a special Day CHRISTMAS and as my dad was getting very stressed and affected .

Embassy Suites by Hilton Indianapolis Downtown,Indianapolis,1.0,"I usually love this place but this last visit was horrible. It was under construction and they were working on the room above us. Hammering and drilling early in the morning. I didn't get my happy hour drink tickets and never did during my stay.

The assistant general manager Mike Marcrum was rude. He was yelling at me in the lobby in front of everyone. He did not like that I complained about the service. I informed him how they make a difference between Black and White people. First thing he said was ""I'm not a Racist"", and mentioned the lady supervisor who was Black, had been his friend for years. If your not a racist no need to say it. People in the lobby were upset how he was talking to me. The White lady went to desk and said he did not need to talk to me that way.

The Supervisor Debbie Flemming was wonderful. She was apologetic for how he treated me and said she wish he would of pulled me aside. He was her manager so she could not do much, but have empathy. I appreciate her. Ol' Mike said he would get back with me, but never did. He said I needed to deal with Priceline. I did notice he comped me for 1 of my days, but that was not enough.

I called corporate, but they said they would pass the message along. Its been a week and I have not heard anything from them. They did say its not much they can do because I went through a third-party. The third-party did nothing wrong is was Mike!!!

They did not do social distancing. The pool was not monitored adequate so everyone could swim. The elevators were packed full and only 1 working. Not to mention the police got called on Mike Saturday because of his behavior toward a guest. We all had to evacuate because the fire alarm got pulled. Kids were also sleeping in the stairways. It was a crazy stay.

I'm just so disappointed and this used to be my favorite hotel. I couldn't wait to check out and come back to Georgia. I almost forgot...Mike said he was yelling because he was death. No excuse because he was on the phone and I barely hear him talk. Other guests complained about him as well...he talks over people and rude. They need another manager. He will run across the wrong one eventually. Karma has no time limit! I guess since the hotel is turning super ghetto he thinks he can treat people any kind of way!

Hilton Garden Inn Philadelphia Center City,Philadelphia,3.0,"The room accommodations were great at this Hilton Garden Inn. We got a junior suite with two queen beds while in town for the Roots Picnic at Fairmount Park. The hotel is right next to the convention center and within close walking distance of the Reading Terminal. Our room wasn't ready as early as we hoped, for early check in, but still got it a little before 3pm. Since our flights landed first thing in the morning, we needed to get ready and have bathroom access to change and freshen up. For whatever reason their lobby restrooms require key access which seems silly. The main complaint was one of the ladies working the front desk was rude and sarcastic. I didn't get her name but she wears a bun. Winston, on the other hand, was the Trinidadian gentleman with a wide high top haircut who worked around the clock and would store our luggage for us before our room was available and after 11am on check-out day. Friendly and efficient guy.

Sorry but the lady working the desk lowered the rating. Customer service is key. I understand anxious customers wanting to get in the room before it's ""ready"" but she could've handled it differently. The hotel itself is in a good Center City location giving us quick access to key places and comfortable room amenities. The shower water didn't get as hot the first night, but it wasnt cold.

The wedding reception was at this hotel, so naturally I decided it would be good to stay here. I called a few times during the week to make sure my friend could check in before I did and that our room would be ready in time. They did allow my friend to check in before me as I was taking a late flight in. During the week I had called to make sure we had the two queen beds that I made the reservation for and they kept saying we were all set. You won't imagine the complete disappointment I felt when I got there ,and we had one bed in the room. I immediately went to the front desk to inform them. I made a reservation for 2 beds not one because I do not like sharing a bed. It is not complicated to give me what I pay for. Especially when I booked to stay there for three nights.I booked this months ago.The front desk gave me free breakfast vouchers and told me the issue would be resolved  in the morning. First thing in the morning I went to check on the status of our room change. The front desk manager said there was nothing she could. She said she's doesn't know why we were told we would get our room switched. She said that all the rooms were booked because of a volleyball tournament. Unbelievable, how was that my fault that they over book and don't care about their customers. She was cold and showed no care and it was clear she did not care to rectify the situation.They offered to give us a rollaway bed, but that was not okay for us. Had my friend's wedding not been here I would have left in a heartbeat. This place only gets another star because the shuttle bus staff Fred was super friendly when picking us up from the mall.

Of course we were in New Orleans during a weekend, so we were out very late. Check out is at 11am, so then why did 2 people knock on our door before 10am? 1 person was house keepings, the other was some guy just asking us when we were checking out. While trying to get sleep, this was obnoxious. After that time, we decided to extend our stay for half a day since our flight didn't depart until 5:40pm. We called down to front desk but we were put on hold for a long period without explanation. When we called back, the lady said ""Can you just come down here? I have everyone in front of me checking out"". We extended our stay through 4pm. After that, FOUR more people knocked on our door. After the 2nd one, I politiely asked that people stop knocking on our door. There wasn't a ""Do Not Disturb"" door hanger.. The last person that knocked on our door didn't actually knock. She used her key card and opened the door and rudely asked if we were checking out. I explained we extended our stay and she said ""Ok Front Desk will be calling you""... What the heck for?
The communication between the staff is horrendous, and resulted in us getting horrible sleep and being put into a horrible mood. We even asked for a late check out and were denied, even though the gentleman running the bar told me they were only 47% full.

There was trash all over the floors. The elevator smelled awful!! The elevator itself clearly needed to be cleaned. We got into the room which looked NOTHING like the room we had seen on Hotels.com when we booked. When we booked it had also showed an oven in room to bake, but that was not true either. The room also had a slight odor... Like old sweat and stale garbage.

We grabbed a bit of food to go back to the room. It was nice they had fresh fruit and healthier options. The cooked food was meh. We had left for the afternoon and returned to a straightened room... We had forgotten the do not disturb since with COVID none of the hotels will enter the rooms until after check out, but it was nice to see... That  night we cooked food on the stovetop, and the smoke alarm went off. We got it to stop right away and opened the windows. There was nothing burning or overly smoky.  About 10min later a snooty older woman came knocking on the door being so rude about us not answering the phone because they have the fire alarms set up that if they go off at all in one room then the whole floor will go off...

The Westin Tampa Bay,Tampa,3.0,"Quite lovely hotel with very nice & professional staff. The view of the bay is nice so ask for a room with a bay view. Beds are very comfortable & rooms are very clean. It's up to the standard of Stargate hotels for sure. 

However, most of the complaints about this place are quite true. For example, it's true about the walls being paper thin. If you plan to stay here make sure to bring ear plugs. Lucky for me, I always travel with a pair. 

It's also true that Internet is $10 a day & it's not the fastest speed either which is very annoying when you're paying $10 days. Also they only allow up 3 devices a day per room to connect. So if you both have smartphones & 2 computers one of your devices can't hook up to your room. Kinda lame, I think, especially at $10. 

The restaurant & bar at the hotel is over priced & the food is OK. There are much better places around here to grab a bite at better prices too. 

In regards to the staff being unhelpful, rude & unprofessional, I saw non of that. They were very helpful & nice all the time. A door was ALWAYS opened for me when I would leave or come back. I appreciate that in today's day. 

Would I stay here again if I return to Tampa? Most likely since I have a high status with Stargate Hotels so I get a few perks, like free parking, Internet & I like to acquire my points.

She also said we should just ask for our money back and it will take 10 days until we were refunded. Then threatened to have her ""inspector"" check out our room.

I was in New Orleans for a week attending a conference at this hotel. First, it's a nightmare to navigate. I won't put that all on the hotel, but yeah....nightmare. They need better signs. The place is also filthy. Like, just run down and nasty. 2 drawer pulls in my room were broken, the tv got awful reception, there was a big brown mystery stain on my shower curtain that made me gag whenever I noticed it.  It's not the quality you expect for what they charge. I've stayed in nicer Best Westerns.

On Monday, NOLA put out a boil water advisory. I checked in about 4 hours after this advisory was released, but wasn't told until many hours later, and then only because I tried to order a coffee. This was after I had showered, drank water, and brushed my teeth....so awesome.....probably picked up some ridiculous swamp bacteria.....

I called down to the concierge one night to see if they had a list of places that will deliver to the hotel (this was after I called two places on my own that said they won't deliver due to ""security issues""). The lady who answered put me immediately on hold, then when I did get her and started to ask my question she cut me off with a terse ""um, pizza places"". Okay, lady......I'm sorry my unreasonable request pissed you off.

I ordered room service Thursday at 815. Didn't get it until 1030.....it cost me over $70 for a shitty glass of wine, 8oz of steak, canned greenbeans, and a baked potato that even Wendy's wouldn't have served. The wifi in my hotel room (that costs $12 a day) went out Thursday afternoon and still wasn't up when I checked out today. They claim to cater to business travelers....well, those people often need access to the freaking Internet.

I will never stay here and am not likely to even use a Hilton again because they were just rude, unaccomodating, overpriced, and filthy. Theres 30 hotels within a couple blocks of here.

Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Dwtn-Union Stn,Indianapolis,1.0,"This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a hotel. The staff was awful, just awful. We didn't end up completing our stay because of how poorly we were treated. On 9/22 my friends and I went to this hotel for a bachelorette party. We came in around 2 in the morning. Now, you may think, ""oh, bachelorette party, must have been wild and crazy,"" but that's not really my scene. I'm a pretty subdued person, we went to Crackers, ate some sushi and hungout for a bit. Of course we had been drinking, but in no way a ridiculous amount. We headed back to the hotel to open the presents my friends had gotten me. 2 of our friends went to grab some pizza and there were three of us in the hotel room. Within 15 minutes of arriving there, a police officer shows up at the door. When my maid of honor answered it, he just says, ""Yea, way too loud."" We had been talking in very normal voices, but we did have the tv on. When my friend reacted in surprise he again just repeated we were being too loud and walked off. He behaved in a super rude manor and we were left totally taken off guard.
So of course we concede. We turned off the TV and and talked in even quitter tones, we were barely above whisper. The officer must have literally walked downstairs and immediately called us again because it was less than 2 minutes since he left our room that the phone rang and it was the officer again telling us to be quiet. By this time we're convinced he has the wrong room but he hangs up on us. We haven't made any noise above low talking, a kind that would be very well acceptable in a museum or something similar. So my friend calls the main desk to ask whats going on and  my maid of honor and i sit there and silently listen to her conversation. Before she can even get off the phone the police officer is back at our door now with a noise complaint, only it has the WRONG ROOM NUMBER and TIME. When my maid of honor points it out, he just says, ""ignore that, this is still for you."" I'm sitting next to the bed eating a cupcake my friend had made for me, and he accuses me of smoking. When we respond with a, ""what the hell are you talking about, that's a cupcake,"" he tells me my hands were too close to my mouth. At this point, its been less than 20 minutes since we walked into the hotel and we'd had enough. We packed are stuff and got ready to leave. I went down first to personally talk to the front desk to see what on earth was even happening. I was still convinced it had to be a mistake, and if I could just talk to them they would be reasonable and make this right. The front desk tells us there is nothing they can do and then the police officer walks up from the back room and accuses my friends of being completely intoxicated. He verbally accosts me for a while about myself and them. At this point, (I mean, come on, this is my only bachelorette party I'll ever get) I start to cry. I asked them why they are doing this, and we would just like to leave and have our money refunded. They said they wouldn't refund us, AND they are going to charge us for all the rooms around our room! By now my friends are downstairs with all of our bags and they start to argue with the front desk. Aft this point the officer again accuses my maid of honor of being intoxicated she asked him to breathalyze her so she could prove that she was not intoxicated. He laughed at her and walked away. When my friend brought up the fact that he had given us a complaint with an incorrect room number and time, he proceeded to go to grab a stack of complaint letters and start THROWING THEM at us! He said, ""here's one for you, and you and one for your lawyer!""  At this point I exited the building in tears. I couldn't believe that ANYONE would behave that way! So while I tried to calm down out front, my friends continued to argue with the staff. By this point, they are very mad about how they are being treated. After much more arguing and some more awful things happening that I don't have the energy to type out happened, we piled into our car and left. 
I have never, ever in my life had such a terrible experience. I will never go to a Crowne Plaza hotel or any of its affiliates. We asked for the police officer's badge number, and he gave us a false one. After much researching, we figured out who he is and are currently filing formal complaints with the Indianapolis PD and Crowne Plaza. He is an off-duty police officer that Crowne Plaza hired to work security. I couldn't believe that the staff of this hotel just stood by and allowed him to verbally accost us, make false accusations, and behave so unprofessionally. 
So if you ever stay in downtown Indianapolis do not choose the Crowne Plaza. You will be disappointed and mistreated by their staff, and quite possibly end up crying on a street corner at 3 am.
Oh, and they charged 27 dollars for the vallet and didn't warn us. There is no easy way to get to other parking so its pretty much your only choice.",-0.09652316192680777

Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"Do yourself a favor and stay away from this hotel. This is one of those businesses that deserves a zero star review. I picked this hotel as a stopover on a drive from the East Coast to the West Coast because of its location right on the Mississippi River (after all Riverside is part of its name). However, what I got was a room that opened into the hotel lobby atrium. When I asked for another room I was told they didn't have any rooms with a better view even though the Hotel was only 80 percent full for the night. I was then given a room but I was told would overlook the courtyard, but my view was of a solid wall 8 feet away from the window. 

Other than the staff at the gift shop, all of the staff here I have dealt with have been surly it's not rude. Certainly not anything I'm accustomed to and a far cry from true southern hospitality.

One final note, the room had a heavily chemical odor.waking up this morning I'm sure that chemical odor was to cover mold and mildew you given the fact that I can barely breathe.

This may be the only hotel directly on the river in New Orleans, but there certainly nicer hotels nearby and it certainly isn't worth the premium price. Plus there's never any reason to have to deal with surly rude staff. Just don't stay here!!!",0.09610872758194186
Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,1.0,"Arrived a PLATINUM member, was treated with indifference and actually was talked to like a fool as I was using a Marriott Friends & Family Rate. I forgot the certificate and was having it faxed and told them i would have likely in next 8 hours. Should not matter checking out in 2 days and would be resolved easily. Was told need immediately. They called my room 2 times within 5 minutes of checking in and was lectured after I went to bus Services to try and get on computer to get ahold of friend as I left personal cell phone home. The Supervisor was rude as I have ever encountered. My friend called hotel as the fax was malfunctioning and she finally got through after hours of trying and all was good. Well until I went to the restaurant. There again a rude Hostess who did not acknowledge my presence for at least 5 minutes then was told to wait she had a phone call lol! Finally seated Waitress excellent. Next morning went to breakfast and was told after another 5 minutes of leaning on the hostess desk they were not open until 6 am. It was 610 am. Rude as I have EVER encountered in ANY Marriott my hotel of choice always if I can get rates company allows.

Upon checking out again utter rudeness not to me but comments about person who called and the phone rang at least 40 times before she answered. I was trying to checkout and they did not have all charges posted properly including breakfast (but the gift shop transaction from 2 minutes prior was there and they are not Marriott). Was told would get email. None came. Expenses due. Now I call hotel and rudely am told will take 3 days at least. Unacceptable.

I will mention I tried to call for wakeup call, no answer on 3 tries.

I think you need to do a secret shopper test of the restaurant hostess as well as the front desk. The service is non existent except for the excellent wait staff.OT a chance. May stay again if rate under 100 per night but no way otherwise. Platinum members butter the bread and sometimes they use special rates but stay loyal to a usually superior brand.

The staff needs to go to Renaissance at the Newark, NJ Airport and see how this is run. The staff there from shuttle driver, front desk, hostess, wait staff and Managers are EXCELLENT!

Truly an absolute disappointment and still appalled it takes 3 days or more in 2014 to email a bill. PS I get it within an hour from the Newark Marriott!

Could I have eaten breakfast elsewhere? Yes, but I thought the hotel wanted to generate revenue internally! FAIL! Fail! Fail. The room however was  very clean!

We booked the jacuzzi room and were excited to use it; however, the tub handle broke on the second day. The night manager lent us channel lock pliers to work the faucet, but he took them back the next day without fixing the tub. Upon checkout I asked to pay a regular room rate for the third day. While the front desk staff was accommodating, the day shift manager reluctantly (and somewhat rudely) agreed to charge me the regular room rate for the last day. The bed was comfortable and although we were right next to the pool there was very little noise. I was a little worried about crime in the area and found out later from a local it can be a high crime area....so don't go out alone at night (nothing untold happened to us though).

Best Western Plus French Quarter Courtyard Hotel,New Orleans,1.0,"**BUYERS BEWARE**
I HATE to have to write this review but I just want to be honest. I travelled to this hotel to spend my spring break from college and while I was out having a wonderful time seeing the sights in New Orleans, the cleaning staff was busy stealing my sister and my belongings rather than cleaning our room. 

We came back to an unmade bed, ""tidied up"" end tables, coffee table, and tv stand, our dirty clothes put into bags, and clean towels. Why they didn't make the bed or touch the sink area is beyond me. Seems like they ""tidied up"" each surface they decided they wanted something from. 

Thank GOD we locked our wallets up or else they would have been gone too, I just didn't think to lock up her perfume or the Mardi Gras beads I purchased the night before. 

My sister sent an email to Best Western about this issue to pursue it further and we STILL have not heard back from them which is just plain RUDE!
It's a shame this hotel doesn't do anything about the dishonest cleaning crew working there, as I've seen many postings about the maids stealing people's belongings. 

I will say that the hotel staff we SO NICE! The bartender and each front desk member I came into contact with were absolutely wonderful! If it weren't for the maids stealing my sister and I'd belongings I would have given this place 5 STARS!!",0.1757635882635883
Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"My company stayed here for a business trip from May 4th to May 10th (6 nights).  On Saturday, May 7th, I returned to my room to meet my husband around 3:30pm.  At that time our room had not been cleaned, which was odd as my husband had said the cleaning people had been on our floor (by our room) all morning long.  I changed my clothes and put my jewelry in my Kendra Scott box and placed it back in the safe.  I called housekeeping and asked them to make sure that they please clean our room.  We returned to our room around 8:30pm Saturday night.  I took of my jewelry and laid it on the dresser.  Got up on Sunday May 8th to get ready to go to my meetings.  Approximately around 8:30am I opened the safe to take out my Kendra Scott box and put on my jewelry.  The box was missing.  We searched the room, no box to be found.  We then called security and reported it.  Security arrived and took the report while in the mean time telling that when I got home I would find it (says it happens all the time).  I assured him it is not at home...I had just been in the night before. Kevyn was the security person's name...he was not apologetic, sympathetic, or anything...just accusatory.  I left for my meetings.  Came back Sunday afternoon and asked to speak to a manager so I could find out the details, the manager knew nothing about it.  I had to explain the entire situation again.  He told me that the cleaning lady was off that day and they could not question her until the next day.  On Monday, May 9th, I returned to the front desk again to talk to the general manager...I was told he was not available.  I was given to another manager, who again did not know what was going on.  This manager's name was ""Lionel"".  He did try to find out, and said he would get back with me.  He did follow up and sent ""Kevyn"" to my room.  Kevyn was so rude and disrespectful.  I had to ask him to leave, when he refused I had to call Lionel to get him to leave the room.  We were told by Kevyn that they had questioned the cleaning lady on Sunday (after I had been told they could not question her due to her being off).  I could not get anyone to answer me on when they really questioned her.  On Monday we requested that the police be called for a report to be placed.  Lionel said that their investigation was completed and they would turn it in to their claims department and they would be contacting me.  I asked for a copy of their investigation and was told I could not have one.The police did come and take our report.  On Tuesday, the day we were checking out, I called Lionel and asked for him to send an email to all of his staff that we were offering a $2,000 cash reward for the return of my grandmother's wedding ring that was in the box, he told me he didn't think they could not do that but would check.  I did call later, he said the general manager (that I have asked to speak to multiple times and have yet to speak to) said they would.  I asked him to please give them my cell phone number as well as copy me on the email so I know what was sent out and they would have my email address..he assured me that he would.  As of today, NOTHING.  Just heard from the ""claims"" department, they have DENIED any payment for the reimbursement of any of the stolen jewelry.  Says they cannot prove negligence on the hotel's part.  REALLY?  When they read the card reader on the door, the only keys that opened that door on Saturday evening was mine, my husband's and the cleaning lady!

Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,4.0,"Beautiful hotel! I was fortunate to get a corner room overlooking the river when I stayed here last. I didn't want to leave! The room was modern, clean, and rather large. The bathroom was also fairly renovated with plenty of counter space. I would definitely stay at this hotel again since it's a short walk to the French Quarter as well as a short drive to the Garden District. Not to mention Harrah's casino is right across the street. The con to staying in this hotel is the staff. While the valet men, and Justin, our room service attendant were top notch, the woman who checked us in was rather unfriendly. Not rude, just deadpan, AND she was training a new desk clerk. She made us feel very unwelcome upon arrival, almost as if we were inconveniencing her by our arrival. The sports bar located in the hotel is terrible. Terrible food, jacked up prices, and even worse service. The bartenders were very loudly discussing their poor tips behind the bar, our server got my order wrong and instead of apologizing she said I had ordered the wrong thing, and when we got our bill it was over $100. I had a plain Caesar salad, my husband had a burger, and we each had two cocktails. Mind you we were only there for 45 minutes. So we paid the bill but did not tip our server 20% of our $114 bill because she certainly did not represent $114 worth of service in 45 minutes. Once leaving SHE was loudly discussing with the bartender our poor tip. Lucky for her I didn't hear it, but my husband did and told me after we returned to our room. The next night, we decided to give it another chance after returning from the wedding we attended in town. It was 11:50, the bar closes at midnight. We did not realize this. Once we sat at the bar the bartender gruffly spouts ""We're closed!"" Without even turning around from closing up the liquor shelf. I said we came in to give it another try, and we did. That sealed the deal for us to never go back. 
Stay at the hotel because it is a beautiful experience, order room service because room service staff is very friendly. Enjoy a conversation with the valet guys, but I do not recommend visiting the bar, and don't expect too much from the staff up front.",0.046971590909090914

The Westin New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"My husband is a Starwood gold member. It was my mother's 80th birthday and we decided to stay at the Westin. He booked a room using his Starwood points, but I booked my mom's room through American Express Platinum membership as I wanted to collect points for travel. When we got in they gave my husband a room on the 28th floor facing the canal , and the room I booked through American Express was on the 14th floor without a view and facing a bunch of electrical equipment.  The room was musty and run down.  I was given a room with a promise for  a better room the next day when some of the guests checked out.  Since it was just for one night I accepted it.  The next day when I called they said the guests hadn't checked out yet to try at noon but they will definitely have a room available on a higher floor with 2 queen beds. When I went downstairs to the reception,  the line was long so I went to my room and called them to see if the room was ready.   William, the manager answered the phone and bluntly said there won't be any rooms available as they were full that day. . I told him that the front office had promised me one.  He was very rude and said that they were full.  I told him I will  go down to talk to the guy at the reception as he had assured me there would be a room available.  I went downstairs, spoke to Brice who was very friendly and polite.  Thanked me for being patient and informed me that my room with 2 queens beds was available. He asked me to go to my room and the bellman will move my stuff. Just when I was about to leave he said, ""Wait a minute, did you speak with my manager a few minutes ago"" when I said yes I had. He said, ""I am so sorry but he just put a note on your reservation asking me not to move you."" He then informed me that he does not have the authority to override the manager as he would loose his job and the best he can do is to get the manager. After half hour the manager turns up and pretends to look at the computer for about 10  minutes and informs me  again that he has no rooms with 2 beds, knowing very well that I didn't want a room with a King bed, offers me a room with just one bed.  I was very polite and I told him but your guy at the front office already has a room for me and he said, ""oh well, thats for someone else."" I have never been targeted this way anywhere else in the world. I am an American Express platinum customer and a Hilton diamond member and I have stayed in many hotels and have never been treated so poorly.  This treatment by anyone in hospitality, leave alone a manager is unacceptable.

I contacted an American Express Concierge and explained the situation so they could handle it.  The Amex agent called the same Westin manager. They said he stuck to his story and was rude.

Later that evening when the managers changed, I approached the new manager Lettrelle, a very pleasant, polite lady. She apologized for the way I was treated and moved me to a beautiful room on the 24th floor with a view of the canal. She sent me a fruit basket apologizing for the way I had been treated. Can you believe that they had rooms available all along and he was just a prejudice individual who targeted me.

I have stayed at many Westins and JW marriotts, etc but never have I ever been targeted this way.  It is outrageous to pay over $300 for a musty smelling dump and to be humiliated this way.

The Westin New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"The problem with this hotel is clearly the management. They do not know what service their staff is providing to their guests.  I am half way through an 8 night stay and wish I could leave. The cleaning staff is unreliable. One day they don't clean at all because I put out the DND sign for a short time when I went to breakfast. They never came to clean. When I asked why the front desk said my room was not cleaned because the DND sign was out at all. Apparently, it was my responsibility (according to the front desk) to call for service if I leave out the DND sign even for a couple of minutes because it is assumed I don't want service at all if I leave out the DND sign for any period of time.  Was should a guest have to assume anything so outside the norm.? The next day them came but did not vacum, change the sheets, clean the bathroom floor, clean the glass or replace them or notice that we were out of toilet paper.  Also, the overflow drain the the bath tub fell off, revealing all the grude in the drain. I thought the cleaning staff would report it to maintenance when they cleaned the tub. I should have called myself since I assumed to much about the training of the cleaning staff -to report maintenance issues. Now I have to deal with it or avoid baths. The breakfast staff could not remember ketchup and Tabasco dispite two requests. Another day, I had to wait 20 minutes at the omlet bar for them to get more eggs for eggs over easy.  Won't make the mistake of eating at the breakfast restaurant a third time, even though it would be convenient.  I ordered room service for two pots of tea. I got two tea bags put only one pot of water and cream enough for only one pot. Of course, I was charged for two pots. I called the concierge. No one picked up and I left a message asking for a recommendation for a laundry mat. I never got a call back. I can say that the valet staff is friendly and quick.
To add to my previous review, I specifically called housekeeping today when I left the room at noon to say I was leaving and would like my room cleaned and to please change change the sheets. I just returned at 8:00 pm and the room was never touched. How completely ridiculous.",0.11033333333333334
Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,4.0,"Nice hotel and very convenient location to the airport.  Amazing service by Michael Scott, we had an issue with our hotel reservation booked on Priceline.com....won't ever use priceline again. However, Michael was able to correct their error, was very patient with us and provided great customer service. 

The breakfast buffet was ok....the chef who made our breakfast omellete was great and it was delicious. All of the restaurant staff provided good service.  

The reason for the four star is due to the operator/receptionist service, when you dial 0- I believe the name she provided was Aliya or Shaniya....she was horrible and rude. I asked her to add my Marriott rewards number and she informed me to call them directly in a sarcastic tone.  Also, the sheets and towels could use an upgrade.

Otherwise, room was clean and was a standard hotel room setup.",0.2961111111111111
Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"When I returned home I realized someone who had access to my room went inside my travel tote and took a box set of exercise DVD's ($80's worth). I immediately contacted Hilton Security, gave them all the information requested and was told they would get back to me within 2 days. 5 days later I have yet to hear back. 

The bartender at the restaurant on the first floor delivered horrible service. He was unfriendly, refused to speak to us and was irritated when I had to ask him 3 times for a glass of water, and 2 times for a refill. He gave my husband the wrong order and was visibly upset when we requested he take it back. He walked away and we had to flag down another bartender to take care of it. 

The coffee shop on the second floor next to registration promotes hours they do not honor. The executive lounge on the 26th floor promotes wine/beverages at 6:00 pm but does not honor. 

Although the location was convenient, it is not worth patronizing a hotel that has a rude staff, things go missing from your room and you can not get a cup of coffee without walking outside. With so many choices in the vicinity, we will not be staying at this property in the future.",-0.0738562091503268

We needed 2 double beds. Then we called 1 week prior to our stay to confirm our double/ double room. When we arrived they said they're sorry they only have a king room and they can't do anything about it. The Rooms are dark, musty and old. Then we ordered breakfast for the next morning the night before. They showed up missing a meal. It took almost an hour to get it. Then in the gym the towels were brown with mildew. They do not air condition the hallways so during the summer you cannot even meet someone in the lobby without sweating!

Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"I was having a little get together and I went to take a look at the hotel before I actually booked the room. I had some special requests. I needed the large round table removed and chairs to be added to the room. They said they can remove the large round table and add additional chairs for me. So I went ahead and booked the room. When I went to check-in, Kasiem, the guy that works at the check-in desk told me that I am not allowed to have any event in the hotel room and that I'm required to rent a banquet room. He also continued to tell me that he cannot remove the large round table OR add any chairs to the room. I went on to say ""yall told me yall could complete my request before I booked the room & now yall don't allow for it?"" His response was ""it's not yall because I was not there and I didn't say that was possible."" I said ""when I said yall, I meant someone at Hilton. You represent the Hilton so it was yall."" So then I get up to my room and call guest services from the phone and they easily accommodated my requests. Kasiem is ill knowledged and needs more training before he states misleading information. 

Our fridge was not cooling our drinks so we called guest services 4 times. And no one ever came to check out the fridge or replace it. Luckily there was an ice machine across from our room. Don't say you will have someone take a look at it if no one plans on it. 

Day before check-in, I also requested to have early check-in and late checkout. I assumed that I was honored the late checkout because no one said anything to me. On my checkout date, the housekeeper knocked on my room from 9-11am in 30 minute intervals. I then had to call guest services again and they told me they did not approve my late check out so I had to leave immediately or I will be charged. What! I request late check out and they decline it but don't tell me until I call?! Unprofessional. The housekeeper was also rude when I opened the door for her. 

Rooms were nice but I would not return especially if they continue to hire staff that is rude and unpleasant to be around!!!

The Westin New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"There is a serious lack of communication between the staff. First we checked in and nothing went wrong. It was difficult to understand her accent when she told us about the weird elevators which is fine. At least she tried to warn us. 

We got a suite but I would not call it that. It was very small like a normal room but clean. 

The first night a woman knocked on our door and would not leave anyway we had the do not disturb sign up. They resorted to calling us. We finally decided to answer to find a fancy champagne cart. She moved it in our room frustrated and left after we said this couldn't possibly be for us. We read the card that said congratulations from two unknown names. We have no reason to be congratulated unless it was for just being alive. So we called the service people and asked if we were suppose to receive this. She frantically looked it up and said no and quickly hung up giving us no information about what we should do with it. An hour later we decided to push it out into the hall. Two hours later a man calls the room and asked ""you didn't drink it did you?"" We informed him we did not and that it is in the hall. He hung up on us.

Fast forward. We attended a wedding and went to our room around 11pm to find our key does not work. So we went down to the lobby and asked an innocent looking girl at the front desk. She didn't know and called over a snobby girl to help her. She also did not know and after we asked her ""difficult questions"" like how much are we being charged she said ""let me get the manager."" So we waited and the manager came and said it's because they are severely overcharging our card. By severely we mean double what we agreed to pay. We asked why and she said they are just holding the amount but it won't be charged to us. We have yet to know if this is true so we are holding on to the bill. She gave us updated keys and we spent one more night in the hotel.

The next morning we packed up and went down to valet parking to pick up our car. We gave them the ticket and they were like ""uhhh did you pay yet?"" We said yes and showed them the bill with the parking charge. She called someone and 30 mins later she got a call back. I don't know what was said but we got our car and left.

I think she was upset that we were not going to order anything else. My butter knife had old egg yolk on it, I asked her for another knife. She brought me one wrapped in a paper towel. Do you really think I'm going to use it? I have never experience wait staff so unprofessional, she never came by to ask us if we wanted refills on our coffee. After my sister asked for a refill of coffee, she looked at my cup which was almost empty, asked anyone else want refills.  She just  plopped the bill, without saying a word, no thank you, not a single word. Needless to say, we didn't leave a very good tip, $.06.

Fearing that hotels might be prickly about such things, I called the Hilton on Friday evening informing them of this. The nice lady who answered the phone said that she'd logged this in their systems and that I'd have no problems when I showed up on Saturday. Unfortunately the ""nice lady"" was really the ""incompetent lady"" because when I actually showed up on Saturday the rude receptionist said they had no record of me. Only when I told him I was originally supposed to show up on Friday did he acknowledge my existence in their system (really? Hilton has no ""search for recent/upcoming reservations by unusual last name?""). At that point he said there was nothing he could do because I booked my room through an external party and had been marked as a no-show due to my cancelled flight.

The people here could not care less how rude they are to you, and they have no systems in place, at all, to take care of the simplest things like service breakfast or getting a package, or fixing their internet.  The Internet tech said the wireless wasn't working because I had somehow connected to a router on the 7th floor.....there are only 2 floors.  The manager was apologetic and said she would reduce my rate from $229 to $179....that never happened, so I went to the front desk to explain and the girl would probably still be standing there staring at the computer and shrugging her shoulders had I not just walked away.  I called down at 10:30pm to see if a package had arrived and they said they would have to call me back, which they never did.  I went down in the morning to ask for it in person and the girl stared at me like I was asking for her firstborn.

The Westin New Orleans,New Orleans,1.0,"I stayed here for three nights in mid-March for a conference which was also at the hotel.  It was not my favorite hotel experience. 

Arriving at the hotel, the bell staff / doormen were fantastic, but imagine my surprise when I'm told I have to heft all my luggage up to the... wait for it... 11th floor in order to check in.  That was just the beginning of the maze of the hotel-- more on that later.  So I made it to the registration desk and checked in, but the gal at the desk didn't even acknowledge me as a Starwood Preferred Guest.  Okay.  

The instructions to get to my room from the 11th floor registration area were probably best suited for a cartographer.  ""Turn around, take a right, then take a left, then a right to the guest room elevators."" Alrighty, so the bank of elevators that brought me up from the street would not also be taking me to my room.  Interesting.

I made it to my room and was pleased with the spaciousness, decor, and features.  The bed was exceptionally comfortable and the climate control was easy to use and very quiet.  My first night of rest was pleasant.

The next day was the first day of conference activities, which took place on three different floors of the hotel, some of which could only be accessed by getting off the guest room elevator and then on the other elevator bank.  People were endlessly confused by this and made for a logistical nightmare when migrating between sessions and meetings.  

The time change caught up with me and I was ready to get another good night of rest after our day of meetings.  I fell asleep easily but was woken at about 3 a.m. by a pack of rowdy, drunk boys piling in to the room next to me.  They talked and laughed in very loud voices, and it sounded like they were inflating an air mattress to blow Just as I was about to call the front desk, they left.  Like annoying feral cats, they all returned again around 6 a.m. and were even more intoxicated, loud, and obnoxious.  I thought for sure they'd pass out but no, so I called the front desk.  

I couldn't believe how rude the girl at the front desk was, her curt demeanor implied she thought I was the nuisance for complaining about a posse of inebriated men disrupting the peace and quiet of the hotel.  She never apologized for the disruption or inconvenience.  At least she kept her word and sent someone up who quieted the boys down.

By my third night I was really, really tired.  Once again, despite the comfy bed, the boys next door were back in action around 3 a.m., this time not only drunk and talking loud but also smoking marijuana! The smoke filled up my room and made me ill.  I immediately called the front desk.  Once again, the attendant was curt, rude, and didn't once apologize for my troubles.  He even hung up on me!

I was just appalled that they didn't offer a solution to the problem that tarnished two consecutive nights of my stay.  They didn't offer to move me, or move the bad guests, or offer me any sort of apology or accommodation.  Not to mention the fact this all took place on the Starwood Preferred Guest floor! If this is how they treat guests in the loyalty program then I'd hate to see how they treat everyone else!!

When I checked out and received my bill, the attendant asked me how my stay was.  I explained that it was not very restful.  True to form, she simply handed me my bill and said sorry.  She made no attempt to solve the problem or apologize.  Hell, she didn't even ask what was wrong! 

Long story short, the staff front desk staff here are awful, rude, and don't give a hoot about your guest satisfaction.  I've had better service and more restful sleep at $60 a night fleabag motels.  For nearly $200 a night you'd think they'd treat you better and attract a more upscale crowd.

A friend of mine explained that this scenario is why, when she stays in NOLA, she stays uptown.  AVOID this place.  Unless of course you are a loud, obnoxious drunk, in which case mob up with 12 of your best pals and cram in to one room here.  It'll be like you own the place!",0.0697343474426808

It took years for them to redo the Sheraton, so for YEARS It was not all that and a bag of chips! 
It did not have a gym for a good year, if not more So please give it a break!
The staff is pretty cool I was a real bitch checking in and they could not do enough, very cool staff. 
The room was clean and I though pretty modern but what do I know I travel for business and see a different 4 star every other week. Carpets get dirty, stuff gets worn and unless you want to pay BIG bucks get over it!
The bed was comfortable, towels soft and plush, no bath matt and the chair in the room looked like some dirty drunk pig rubbed their dirty body on it, and probably did,so tomortow I tell house keeping and all will be well with the world. The designer who decided a white chair would work in a hotel room in Nola was just plain dumb!The room is quite large and the view is not to shabby. The light switches for the night stand is about 3 feet from the bed, I will never understand modern designers who design for lack of comfort, should of placed switch on side of table, so you can find in the dark, but they put white chairs in the  room so must of been a man.
Parking is probably through the roof because of the location. I use ""premium park"" and park 6 blocks away at one of their lots for 15 a day with in and out privileges but a LOT of walking is involved.
The view from the lobby on the 11 floor is marvelous, this was used as the Passport office after Katrina..just some FYI ...
The Mall is attached and you are pretty smack dab right in the middle of THE ACTION ...Trolleys are all around, as are the buses. Great location!
And once again THE valet,the bell boys and the front desk staff ROCK with niceness!
You gotta be a real jerk to get treated otherwise!
The ceiling is popcorn but due to age of hotel I highly doubt it is asbestos. Asbestos use in ceilings was banned in 1978 in the clean air act.
The gym is roomy, very well maintained and clean. Lots of equipment and machines.
Three separate  areas to work out in.
OMG The roof top pool is Awesome!
One if the best in Nola. It was cold and windy the night I went up there but the water was warm, if I was 20 years younger and still living on the edge I would of gone for a swim it was so warm but swimming alone on one of the coldest nights of the year did not seem very intelligent to me, where is my hubby when I need him!

Best Western Plus French Quarter Courtyard Hotel,New Orleans,4.0,"Pros: friendly, accommodating front desk staff, great location, beautiful courtyard, comfy bed, decent shower. That's what the 4 stars is for.

Cons: We were here for a week, and our room was barely cleaned. One day, they skipped cleaning it altogether. When we ran out of kleenex and toilet paper, it wasn't replaced. I had to go pick some up from the supply area. The rug wasn't vacuumed when we checked in and didn't get vacuumed until 3 nights later. They don't dust well in between guests, as I found a piece of gum stuck on the underlip of my nightstand. I left it there to see if our maid would notice it, but it's still there. Why someone would stick their gum there is pretty gross and rude, but not cleaning it up is worse.",0.14652777777777778
Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel,Indianapolis,2.0,"It honestly pains me to lower my rating of this particular hotel. I've stayed here probably about a half dozen times, and have always been pleased. This last visit may prevent me from ever considering a future stay at this particular Sheraton.

We checked in this past Saturday for a two night stay. We were here for the Colts game, and used our AMEX Starwood points, and were given one of the old, non remodeled rooms with two double beds. I normally would not have a problem with this, seeing as though we were technically not paying customers as we used our points; BUT, we were promised a King when we reserved over two months ago...

A little upset, but not overly concerned, and not contemplating a complaint, we started to get ready for dinner. After about a half hour in the room, we realized that the heat was not working. The room was frigid, and there was a healthy draft coming in through the window. I figured the hotel was booked, seeing as though we were placed in a crappy room, on an outdated floor.

I called the Front Desk, and was greeted by the rude, condescending jerk of an employee, ""Adrian."" Adrienne was a real jewel. I informed him / her that our room had no heat. He didn't seem to care, offered no apology, and said  the hotel was at ""capacity."" But, the Customer Service pro that he / she is, Adrienne offered to have a space heater brought up to our room! A ""space heater"" I responded. He said ""yes, a space heater."" 

ME: Okay, leave it outside the room as we're getting ready for dinner.

ADRIENNE: No, I can't do that as it may end up in someone else's room.

ME: {Laughs} Seriously? Okay, can you please bring it up soon, before we leave for dinner, as I don't want anyone in our room when we're gone?

Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,4.0,"I love this place but ....

Let's start with the good stuff cause there's lots of it. A clean, comfortable hotel IN the airport. Flying into Philadelphia late at night? You walk off the airplane, out of security and you are AT the hotel. That's cool. The front desk people are awesome, we have an amazing view of the runways (but no noise - how did they do that?), and even the bar is super fun. There's a little store and a Starbucks and if you're buying coffee in the morning, you'll meet Shawn, who is just awesome and friendly and cool. If you see her, tell her Mary said hi. 

But ....

Here's the hard part. Because everyone - especially Shawn - is so lovely here, I had no hesitation at all in letting my 13 year old kid run down to the store for a candy bar on Saturday night.  Now this kid can handle himself, he travels alone all the time and we let him loose in Boston on the regular. So I was stupified when he came back all flustered and upset.  I had given him a few dollars and he decided to bring back candy for everyone so he was a dollar short .... tried to charge to the room but wasn't sure he had the right number ... and the cashier snarled at him and told him she didn't have time to wait for him.  What?!?!  This is not a kid who would be rude or inconsiderate, not that I'd excuse poor service even if he was. But he's got good manners.

Obviously something is up with that cashier.  I went back next morning and made sure that the charge got to the correct room, and I'll speak to management, but it is clear that the truly excellent training at this hotel has not trickled down to one employee. Or maybe she was having a bad night. Whatever, it's no big deal, but it cost the Marriott a star in my book.  And kind of wrecked the kid's night.

We will be back for certain. And next time I will be the one buying the candy. Cause I know a thing or two about customer service and I'm happy to share.",0.198189187355854

So I called Hotwire who said that the hotel was able to validate the refund so basically they just refused to give me my money back. Second, the hotel is in the ghetto. I am very familiar with tucson as I lived there for two years. It is nowhere near the airport, which is a decent area, it is palo verde/ south alvernon area. Which is the hood! Third, the desk staff are very rude and unwelcoming. And they charged me an extra 20$ ""just in case I charged anything to the room"" that was supposed to be refunded and never was. And last, the hotel is filthy! Like no one cleaned the room in a month. There was dust everywhere, the bed sheets were stained, the carpets didn't look vacuumed.

First time to New Orleans and in the heat of Mardi Gras, I understand that places can get busy but the attitude of the staff and service was ridiculous! I worked at Marriott for years and know good customer service and this wasn't the place for it . I'm not a picky person and not one to complain at all but I will probably NEVER stay at a Westin again! When we arrived, the bellman was arguing with the valet being so unprofessional I was just irritated they were actually having this conversation right in front of me. In regards to the front desk & reservations - We paid for the rooms upfront, called to say we were arriving late and they said ""it will not be a problem."" But because we arrived at the hotel at 1:00 AM (because of a late shuttle), it was ""considered the next day"" so they gave our room away which WE PAID FOR and said we were considered a ""no show"" because it was the next day. No apology, no concern. They said that we would be charged a NO SHOW FEE on top of it!!!  They didn't even offer to contact any other hotels to see if any rooms were available.  I had to ask them and they acted like I was bothering them do do so!  They called ONE hotel!  I understand it was Mardi Gras and rooms can overbook, but we were already charged for the room. They said if we stayed in the lobby, we would be asked to leave!! Unbelievable!!!!!  So we tried to make the best of it and hit Bourbon Street, but by 6am, I was beat! We waited in the lobby until they finally gave us a room at 11:30am.... again, very rude and no concern at all that were on the streets all night and completely ruined our plans the next day since we didn't sleep.

Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel,Indianapolis,1.0,"Before I start, I will say that the front desk is friendly, as is one of the managers, but the General Manager (Bill) is inattentive, dismissive, and rude.

I was worried about this hotel as I had heard about many bad experiences from my colleagues. My own experience was a nightmare. I did not even continue to stay there despite a stay 5 nights get 1 night free SPG promotion, which I could have gained more nights for. There were so many issues that I've made them into bullet points here:

1. The bathroom water (soiled water) overflowed on the 9th and 10th floors 
2. The faucets started emitting brown water (which some people accidentally were already mid-showered b/c no one told them) before the hotel temporarily shut the water down. 
3. Gross spots on the bed mattress
4. I grabbed a granola bar in the Club Lounge, only to later open it - take a few bites- and realize it was moldy. I was horrified, that is a serious health issue. I called the hotel very upset so that they could remove the granola bars from the Lounge, and I was furious and demanded to be called by the GM. I informed them at that time I would contact FDA/ Health Department for health violation. They promised to call him. I heard nothing for about a week. Only when I returned (because I had booked it already through work) and complained again at the front desk and to a manager did I finally get a call from the GM. He seemed apologetic initially, but skeptical of my complaint. He promised to compensate with points and inspect the food. He called again later that day, accused me of lying (I couldn't remember the exact time I called nor the date on the granola bar... BECAUSE IT HAD BEEN A WEEK!!), and said that they get complaints like mine 10 times a week. I was infuriated and insulted, but most importantly worried. What kind of a hotel doesn't care about food complaints?! Further, I brought up my concern of prior issues in the hotel, and he claimed that he knew exactly who it was who complained b/c he knew where I worked...he then proceeded to name a company I do not work at. 

I acknowledge that the above 3 situations were resolved. But at the expense of my faith in this hotel. The GM was incredibly defensive, rude and accusatory in his emails and phone conversations with me. He also was highly aggressive by placing multiple calls to my hotel room when i was staying at the hotel to interrogate me regarding the food situation. I became so uncomfortable I vowed to never stay at this hotel again unless every other hotel in the area was booked out.

I'm driven to write this now as AGAIN an issue has arisen. When I initially checked into this hotel I asked the front desk if I was all set for the SPG promotion of staying 5 nights and get 1 free night at any Sheraton. I was told ""You're all set,"" I didn't need to take any further action to register. I just called SPG (I am a platinum member) to use this promotion and was informed this was not the case. I asked SPG to resolve the issue. I then received an unsolicited email from Bill Seitl first asking me whom the staff member was (it is not my job to record which staff members tell me information), then again to deny the request which SPG put in for me (they were trying to determine how to best meet the promotion). He was rude, dismissive, and callous in his emails and phone conversations. The worst experience I have EVER had with a hotel.

I travel a lot for work, but I've never had such an awful experience where I've felt the need to post online.

Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,2.0,"I was utterly disappointed with this hotel. It fell well short of my expectations - ESPECIALLY since the room type we're in is selling for well over FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS per night!! We did not pay that much - I booked an award stay - but if I had paid that much I'd be out of my mind livid and demanding a refund. 

This is a convention hotel. That means it's huge, and you need to plan 20 minutes to get from your room to the outside or the parking garage or anywhere because you have to hike through a maze of second and third buildings, convention space, and forever long hallways. 

Our 'suite' had NOTHING at all that typically qualifies a room as a suite. It was spacious, but oddly just empty blank undecorated space. There was a mini fridge, with a rude plaque stating that the contents were electronically monitored - even though the fridge was EMPTY! So you don't want me to what, disassemble and steal the fridge interior...? So tacky. 

The furniture was all in terrible condition. Beat up, drawers wouldn't open/close, glass table tops with smudges/fingerprints, dirty smudge/streaks on random walls, beat up table edges, peeling veneers, moldy looking shower grout, etc. 

There was literally not even an extra blanket in the room. I had to call down to ask for one and they brought me a sad, ratty looking rag of a blanket. It was downright embarrassing. I have seen homeless people with nicer blankets! 

From trash in the elevator and hallways to cigarette butts just outside the doors to stained hallway carpeting, this place just feels like a dirty, grimy, smelly, run down old town Vegas convention hotel. 

The 'executive lounge' was an absolute joke and not worth the elevator wait to get to it. 

The parking garage is dark, scary, and very very smelly. Oh and it costs $39/night.

(yeah, you gotta watch a lot a movies if you're going to hang out on my reviews).

I travel a bit for work, so the hotel staff are just as important to me as a crust-free television remote.  And the staff here are amazing. The concierge helped me book my 3-hour City/Katrina our, locate 2 wine bars, book my airport shuttle, and find me the number to report a rude cabbie in less than 15 minutes.

A side word  about the cabbies- at least mine. And the word? Is jackass.  When you arrive at the taxi stand, there are signs everywhere that say all taxis take credit cards. Sweet. After a 30-minute silent cab ride, where I may or may not have died twice, I hand him my card.

Him:  Amercian Express?!? They're going to charge me, like, $5.00 for this!
Me: OK.
Him:  Don't you have another card?
Me: No.
Him:  Why didn't you tell me that before we left?!?
Me: You didn't ask.

The concierge apologized and said she hopes it doesn't ruin my impression of the city. She even gave me free tickets to a comedy show--which they probably gave to everyone, but I appreciated the facade.

The Meeting & Catering Staff are phenomenal, as well. They were professional and always smiliing and made our event completely flawless.  If you are planning a work function here, I highly recommend it for the staff as well as the location.  It was super close to Riverwalk, shopping, Harrah's, Aquarium, and the French Quarter.  

OK, so that was the equivalent of saying ""the hotel had a good personality"". Here's where you find out that it weights 450 pounds, quotes ""Lord of the Rings"", and lives with it's mom--

1. The rooms aren't all that....peaceful.  My first room was, to use my big-girl words, icky.  I took off my shoes and stepped in something...wet.  Ewww.  Then the light fixtures had brown spots. I chalked it up to paranoia and decided to give it a go. Only Loudest Family Ever moved in next door and I had to go.  (Kudos to front desk and bell staff for making my room transition quickly and smoothly!).

The second room was also less peaceful. The black out drapes wouldn't close all the way and I got this awful, horror movie-like glow around the door from the hallway. I kept hearing a really strong wind, but everytime I looked out the window never saw the palm trees moving. It took me 2 days to figure out the noise was from the elevator banks.  

2.  While I love that it is a huge 9,000 square foot complex with tennis courts, squash courts, spa and personal trainers; I found $12.00 a day a bit excessive for using the treadmill for an hour.  I realize they make more money charging a flat rate, but I would have appreciated a more pay-per-service approach when the gym is not included in my hotel rate.

The Westin Tampa Bay,Tampa,2.0,"This review could easily be a 1 star review, and it could have just as easily been a 4 star review. It all comes down to customer service:

We had booked a single king room at this Westin for three nights through a corporate rate of $150 a night. We called the hotel two times to confirm that we would be able to use the rate. When we get to the hotel, we're told the rate cannot be honored, and that the room will be $175 a night. Fine, stuff like this happens. However, what separates a poor hotel from a good one is how they handle situations like this. After receiving little help from Pamela at the front desk, I ask for the manager. Here's why the hotel could have easily received a 1 star rating. 

Your manager is supposed to be the strongest member of your team, the most adept at handling situations like this one and coming up with solutions to make the hotel and the guest happy. The manager of this Westin, Scott, should not be a manager. Period. 

Scott was brusque, bordering on rude, and informed us that the rate would not be honored, that nobody in his staff had told us on the phone that the rate would be honored (they did, or we wouldn't have booked the room), and that the ""best he could do for us was $165 a night."" With no acknowledgement of my SPG gold status, no offer to really check out the ""best rate"" they could offer me, Scott's pitch felt like  a used car salesman's pitch - ""here's my offer. Take it or leave it."" 

Thankfully, we did not take it. We were about to go to the newly opened Le Meridian in Tampa, which had a room for $155 a night. That's when I checked my SPG app. Scott, the manager, the problem solver, had told me the best rate he could give me was $165 a night. And yet, on their very own app, was the rate of $142 a night. 

We booked this $142 rate without a word or apology from Scott, who either attempted to hoodwink us, or whose customer service skills are so poor that he had no interest in truly assisting us. We dealt with Carlos for the rest of the reservation, and Carlos is the reason this hotel is getting 2 stars. Carlos is somebody who understands customer service, and would make a much better manager than Scott. Carlos was kind, friendly, and recognizing my SPG Gold status, upgraded us to a room with a gorgeous view. 

The rest of the stay was more than adequate. The room was very nice, typical Westin. The restaurant, Aqua, is solid. This hotel could have had 4 stars easily, were it not marred by the terrible service we initially received. 

Would I stay here again? Unlikely. I'd stay at Le Meridian. This hotel was nice, but the location is only good for the airport (not really around anything good in Tampa), and with a manager who is incapable of handling customers with legitimate problems, they don't have much going for them.",0.2944767360011262

I noticed wall paper coming off the walls in various spots along with the furniture and bedding (comforters were just as thin as the sheets) that also looked worn. I tired contacting guest services to get more towels and blankets only for them the hang up then again not answer at all. A major problem I had with my stay is that the shower and sink backed up nasty brown water. The creamer for the in room coffee was curdled, so I went down stair to the Starbucks where I was greeted with rude employee who rolled there eyes while I was giving my order. When I checked out I told the employee about my stay and they refunded the $44 a night parking for my one night. I will never stay at this location again especially after paying nearly $500 for 2 queen beds for one night!",-0.014907407407407421
Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel,Indianapolis,1.0,"Marriott desperately needs to modernize the property and replace most of the staff. I stayed here for work as part of a large group, checking in on Monday and checking out on Thursday. Check in was fine but was not welcomed as an SPG member and asked them to verify that my SPG rewards were reflected in my reservation. I went up to my room and it was OK--a little sad looking from water damage, old toilet, worn carpet but it initially seemed decent enough. But when I pulled back the bed covers later that night to get into bed I realized that the sheets were stained and dirty--totally gross. I picked up the phone to call downstairs but it didn't work. So I got in the elevator and informed the front desk-- The woman handling my complaint didn't even say a word back to me, she just disappeared into the back room. A minute later she returns with a bunch of bedsheets in her hand and tells me that the last housekeeping person had already left for the day and PROCEEDS TO TRY TO HAND ME THE SHEETS TO MAKE MY OWN BED. I declined, stating that I don't stay in a hotel to make my own bed or deal with biohazards. I asked for a new room since no one was there to deal with the sheets. I was told there were no other rooms available and she then asked the other front desk staff member to go upstairs and make my bed for me. Mary came upstairs and is soon as she saw the bed she immediately called back downstairs to the manager to get me a new room. I had booked a king room but the only room that they had available for me was a double. By this time I was so tired that I didn't care what the room was as long as it was clean. Mary took me to my new room and gave me breakfast vouchers for the café in the lobby as well as access to the club lounge. I felt a little bit better about that initially because she had tried to make it right. However, when she left and I went to check the sheets in my new room I found that one of the beds had VERY stained bed sheets, thankfully there was a second bed in this room which did have clean sheets so I was able to get to bed. I woke up in the morning to see just how dirty the room was-- stained and peeling ceilings, mildew in the toilet, food and crumbs in the corners of the room, broken wardrobe, no working phone, the list goes on and on. Literally the only good thing about the room was the view of the monument. I complained at the front desk and was again told that my room cannot be changed because they were totally booked. At this point I was very frustrated but never once received an apology from anyone at the front desk for any of these inconveniences. On top of all of this, the parking garage is disgusting and totally unsafe. The breakfast for which I received vouchers was a buffet. I ate there three mornings in a row--the coffee tasted like it had been filtered through old, mildewy towels and the food was literally the same thing every single day (no change in menu at all). I decided to get coffee at the Starbucks in the lobby since the coffee at the buffet was so bad but it took me standing in line for over 20 minutes to simply get a plain black coffee. I also noticed a security concern we are by the staff leave room keys on the counter at the front desk so people can take them and use the restroom on the lobby level. The problem with this is that I accidentally took one of those keys thinking it was my room key but it was not... I realized that later when it didn't open my room but DID open the 10th floor club lounge. These keys are literally just sitting around unattended at the side counter of the front desk. Anyone can walk in off the street and grab one and wander around the hotel. To cap it all off, I checked out on Thursday which was a day early than I initially planned. I did inform the front desk staff of this on Tuesday and was told that it would be no problem. On Thursday morning I handed my keys to the front desk and asked to be checked out. I received my receipt via email on Friday morning and it still showed me checking out on Friday and I was charged for all four nights and four days of parking. When I called to get this corrected, The individual handling my complaint was rude and told me that I needed to communicate my early check out to the front desk. I reiterated that I did communicate it to the front desk on Tuesday and physically turned in my keys on Thursday. 

Honestly, it was just one thing after the next after the next with this hotel. I have never experienced so many lackluster services in my life. And I have certainly never been asked to make my own bed in a hotel. Do not stay here, it is not worth your money. You're better off staying at the JW Marriott or getting an Airbnb in Indianapolis.",0.02275217754133417
Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"We just stayed and was very disappointed. We are a family doing a road trip vacation and have been having a great time all across the US. When we arrived at the hotel we instantly felt the cold and indifference towards family. The guy checking us in gave us a rude look and acted very snooty. We have been some of the best hotels across the country and have had great experiences, but not here. Every hotel always gave us a very high floor with view so we can get amazing photos for our vacation. I asked the clerk checking us in if he could get us a room with an view and he smirked telling us, ""I've got the room for you."" When we walked in we were disappointed that all you could see was the roof and part of river. The room didn't have any luggage racks, the soap dispenser was empty, the sink was so small, there was hardly any room to get ready. It's sad because we have been looking forward to New Orleans for a long time. If we ever come back it will not be here. If you have a family, please don't come here.

Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Dwtn-Union Stn,Indianapolis,5.0,"I'm not known for frequently giving 5-star ratings to hotels. I stay in hotels a lot and most of the time I just don't give them ratings. Not because they're bad, just because I end up trying new things often. That said, a hotel is one business that needs to shine the first time for all guests. Crowne Plaza Indianapolis did not disappoint.

First off, let's get the train thing out of the way. Lots of reviewers slammed the place for it. I don't know how long they've been doing this, but when I checked in I signed a sheet acknowledging that this hotel is attached to live train tracks which are used and it gets loud. So I am consenting that I will ""get over it"". Frankly I only heard one (maybe two) trains come through here when I stayed for 3 days, 2 nights. It was loud. Vibrated a lot and felt like it shook the whole building. Woke me up for maybe a minute - I was barely conscious. Honestly I thought the vibration was actually quite good at lulling me back to sleep. Think of it like the folks that sleep through earthquakes.

The hotel was immaculate. The interior design was fantastic and the white statues really make you think of the old days. Like something out of a movie. All of the usual faces that one could imagine would be seen on the platforms of a busy train station over half a century ago. The paint scheme fit perfectly and the atrium portion along the center of the building was lit perfectly with some beautiful skylights and 3-story ceilings. Kudos to whoever had the idea to convert this old train station into a hotel rather than letting it go on whatever register of derelict abandoned buildings. And the kicker would have to be the old train cars they kept inside and converted to rooms for the hotel to use. I would come back again simply to stay in one of those.

My room was flawless, clean and surprisingly modern. I have no complaints to speak of. It was located on the first floor in the center of the building with the windows looking over the indoor pool. Despite being in probably one of the highest trafficked areas, there was little to no noise to be heard from outside (short of the train of course). In the atrium outside there is music constantly playing which is quiet enough that you won't hear it in your room and it still provides in ambiance. Now, I could've been imagining it (or maybe it was ghosts??) but I feel like intermingled with the music were occasional sounds of people talking or trains honking and rolling to give the impression of a train station in operation. Am I making this up?

Lastly, the staff was helpful. Most folks would say a youthful staff (most of them probably around my age) would be lazy and rude but I was quite impressed with how responsive and personally initiative driven the folks were. I had help available when needed at all times. The gym was clean, airy with several standard amenities and easy to access. Outside the bell-hops were quick to offer to call cabs or shuttles or give directions.

Certainly not least worthy of mention would be the great pricing for the quality of the hotel. It has a direction skywalk connection to the convention center but by comparison to all of the other hotels connected to the center, this one was cheapest by a difference of $100. I like Hyatt and Westin and Embassy Suites. But I think if you want a truly unique hotel experience to jazz up your trip to Indy, you should check out this hotel instead.",0.17913274536408874

Best Western Plus Philadelphia Convention Center Hotel,Philadelphia,2.0,"This place needs some work in respect to the quality of basic amenities expected of a hotel. While the hotel staff are friendly and respectful, the quality of the hotel in respect to the price that guest pay was inequivalent. As a frequent traveler, I was quiet disappointed with my stay.  During my weekend stay, I experienced a shower without hot water as well as a broken air conditioning unit.  In the first room that I was assigned to, the shower water was ice cold, and did not heat as expected. When I called down to the front desk to have the shower looked at and fixed, I was told that they would come up to the room to fix it before 9pm. After stepping out for dinner and returning to the hotel room at 10:30pm, I tested the shower, and again, the water was ice cold. I then called down to the front desk again to see if they ever sent someone to the room, and admittedly so, they had not.  i then was moved to another room down the hall with a working shower, however as a trade-off the air conditioning unit was broken. Again the next day i called down to ask if the AC unit could be fixed, however my request were ignored. 

I hope this feedback will be utilized to improve the quality of rooms and service provided for others who may choose to stay at this establish.

The Westin Tampa Bay,Tampa,1.0,"It's actually a shame for me to even give 1 star... I would totally do not give to this place not even one... In fact, I would give instead this 1 star to the gentleman at the front desk wich was the only one mortified about our situation....
This is what happened:
Got a reservation for 2 nights from Sunday March 14th to Tuesday March 16th.
Called Sunday morning and acknowledge the hotel twice ( called them actually twice)!that we weren't able to check in until very late... like 1/1:30 am.... basically the entire Sunday stay paid was gone...but that was my choice. They told me to do not worry that my room was confirmed .
We got there at 1 am and the guy at the reception told us: I'm so sorry for what I'm going to say but we got overbooked and we haven't a room for you until tomorrow but please enjoy out complementary stayed next door...
I was disappointed but hey, at the end they were paying for us to stay in a beautiful place next door.
I have to say that I would suggest the other Hotel ( I won't say the name on here now but I would definitely write a 5 stars review for them).
Woke up on Monday morning called immediately the hotel and I asked if our room was ready and we could eventually get back.
They told me absolutely! We are all ready.
We got back and after a really quick and professional check-in we got our key ( finally!)
We got into the elevator and we immigrated noticed how dirty it was but we thought they were going to fix it probably immediately... we are talking about a Marriott property at the end... I thought. Big mistake!
We got to the room and with our surprise it was a disgusting mess ( please found attached the video) and honestly I thought it was a joke....unfortunately it wasn't!
I kept calm and thought: now, i called Sunday morning twice unknowingly the hotel that we were late and they told me ok but our room got given away and this morning I called and told us that the room was ready and actually it's a shit show..... we were shocked!
Got back to the front desk and they gave to us a different room and apologize but in a really cold way amd with an attitude. I askednto talk with a manager and they said: he isn't on duty at the moment or something like that...
I didn't want to argue so we went to the aqua bar ( the restaurant of the hotel) had some lunch and we tried to enjoy no matter what but I had to do something... so I called the Marriott Corporate office since nobody at the hotel ( including the missing manager) was able to actually understand the seriousness of the situation!
Dirty hotel in particular! I totally understand now the pain of my stomach after we ate ( maybe the restaurant maybe not?!) not sure but definitely everything was unpleasant.... and it isn't the end!
Talked with Kristin at the corporate office explained the situation and sent video And pics with details in her email but she didn't answer or help me any further....
Maybe we aren't enough important for them! at night when we came back to the hotel after being out all day and we our surprise again something was off... our bathroom in the new room was dirty with beard or pubic hair in the shower and even the bathtub.
We were beyond disgusted . I tried to be positive and went downstairs while we were heading to Dinner and i made sure they knew about it and the lady at the desk told me: oh, In was trying to call you to apologize for what happened and we wanted to give you points but you aren't a member....
I looked at her kinda confused...
Your hotel is a mess, you cannot even keep it clean and now I have to almost feel guilty because I'm not part of the marriott program?
Absolutely a disaster!
I can't even believe this is part of the Marriott but after being ignored deliberately from the corporate defined by the busy schedule of ""kristin"" not having time to answer us I'm starting to think that all make perfect sense!

Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,4.0,"Truthfully, this was a 4.5 star stay. First, the location is great. You're right across from the Harrah's casino, if that's your thing. Adjacent to the Mississippi River, if you want to take a river cruise. Connected to an outlet mall if shopping is your thing. I stayed here for 5 days for work, and I couldn't have been more pleased. 

I did not have a car on this trip, so I can't speak to any charges for self parking or services of the valet parking. Anytime I came or went via the main entrance, there was always someone there willing to offer assistance or directions, so all good as far as I was concerned. I did do a lot of walking, so I was in and out via the Riverwalk Outlet Mall quite a bit. It's nice if you have to trek down to the Convention Center that you can do it via the indoor, air conditioned mall and avoid the heat, humidity, and daily afternoon thunderstorm drenching. 

I ordered Room Service a couple of times, and each time the food was good (albeit expensive) and portions were plentiful. I don't think I ever actually finished a meal. The one thing that was a little annoying was the tendency of Room Service to call back roughly 1/2-hour or so after delivering the food to check on me. I get wanting to make sure I was happy, but I felt as if they must have been running short on trays because they would ask if they could pick my tray up. I'm a slow eater, especially at breakfast, so don't rush me! (For the record, I don't think they really WERE rushing me, I just felt like they were a bit too anxious to remove my tray.) There are multiple additional charges when you order Room Service, so be sure to note that if you partake. Each receipt had a line item for 'tip' at 20%, so I didn't leave anything additional. 

Every single member of hotel staff that I interacted with was great. Polite, patient, helpful, and considerate. I didn't encounter a single instance of anyone being rude or gruff. Not once.

The ONLY truly annoying experience here was in the Executive Lounge, and that was an issue with guests, not staff. 99% of my travel is business. I try my best to stay within the Hilton family, despite them not being a preferred brand for my employer. This means I'm lucky enough to have Diamond status, and I get to use the EL in hotels that have them. I go to the EL to work. I spread out my laptop, notebook, papers I might need, and try to get work done while enjoying a nice view and a coffee with snacks. There was a time when that was the norm for EL's across all properties. 

More and more, the EL's have turned into social gathering spots, family play rooms, and out-and-out free-for-alls. On this occasion, as I was in the middle of focusing on a report and fielding calls, the clock ticked 4:55pm and about 8 people entered at the same time, and it became one of the loudest, most raucous, cacklefest of people just not giving two shits about what anyone else might be doing in the space. And these people didn't even know each other. 

It took me a minute to realize that finger-foods go out at 5:00pm, and that's what brought in the crowd. They crowded up to the food, took piles and piles of food on multiple tiny plates, all the while bitching that they didn't like what was being offered, asking staffers why there wasn't any chicken (or whatever other specific thing they were expecting), and, FFS, handling the food with their HANDS. I saw one woman picking up cookie after cookie and examining them before tossing them back on the tray. They yelled at each other to grab something from the fridge and bring it over (""what kind of yogurt they got in there?"") .. And apparently couldn't be bothered to wipe up their crumbs or bus their piles of plates to the tray in the corner for that specific purpose. I mean. Come on. I've seen better manners at Chuck-E-Cheese.

Eventually, I decided it was best for everyone if I just took my work and left. Unfortunately, it was the same story with different players every time I was there near 5pm.  Like I said, it's a 100% guest issue, not a staff issue. Maybe Hilton could implement some sort of policy for the EL's that asks for a certain amount of decorum?",0.13029295051353873

Dirty Shower mildew, mold, human hair and grimey grout due to lack of cleaning! Musty smoke smelling air and musty smelling bedding due to A/C - Heat filters not being cleaned or replaced. I removed the dirty filters cleaned and dried them. Then placed the air filters back into the A/C in which has reduced the smoke odor saturating our room #406. As well the shower was not and still needs cleaned as well as the bathroom mirror and floor are dirty and were not cleaned. Also one bathroom light of 2 is out and bulb needs replaced! All very basic common maintenance procedures that have completely been neglected! #phillyfail #bestwesternplus #selfsanitized
While I am greatful to the Best Western for accommodating my request for early check in. I was not aware of the condition or I would not have stayed. I was in need of rest therefore I took my own actions to clean the air filters in order to  get some needed rest sooner since because the cleaning staff has definitely failed to clean and or sanitize the room we were given! This has been my worst hotel or motel experience especially with COVID-19 risks!!! So far and I have stayed in many accommodations while making a cross country trip! WOODSPRINGS SUITES... I would recommend also Cobblestone by Wyndam but I cannot recommend Best Western Plus when my experience has been disgusting I brought pictures and complaints to them by email they ignored them for so far for hours but they responded quickly in minutes to book them and pay them!",-0.002018229166666656
Hilton New Orleans Riverside,New Orleans,1.0,"My family were register at the Hilton Hotel in New Orleans Riverside with plans to stay for Thanksgiving. On November 24 at 2 am my son was awakened by someone at his door.  Management along with 3 security personal and 5 policemen were at the door.  There was a very rude manager who told my son his dog had to leave.  (When he registered, I asked if they allowed service dogs and they said yes). In defense of the security at the hotel and the police officers, none of them agreed with what the rude manager did.  The security acted scared of this rude manager.  Probably for fear of losing their job.    The rude manager kept insisting for my son to take his dog and  to leave.  My son asked why and rude manager said the was barking earlier that day and the neighbors complained.  My son told him it was a service dog and he needed him with him for his disability.  The rude manager proceeded to tell me son he had to leave.  While this was happening, my son called me.  I was in another room two floors up.  All I could hear was ""mom, mom"".  I immediately went to his room and was completely surprised when I saw the number of security and police at my son's room.  My immediate response was ""oh my gosh, is this a swat team, what is going on?
The rude manager was telling my son he didn't care about him or his dog and to leave.  My son was sleeping when the people knocked on the door and the dog was quite.   He had been barking earlier that day.  I said, well he can come to my room.  Rude manager wouldn't even allow my son to come up to my room.  He was escorted out by the police and security.  Due to his health condition he was confused and couldn't understand what was happening.  He didn't have his phone or wallet and all he had on was a t-shirt,  thin pants and slippers.  He had never been to New Orleans.  It was in a dangerous area which was confirmed by the hotel security and the police.  I could not find my son for two days.   I called the police department to report him missing and spoke with one of the officers who had been at the hotel that last saw him.  I called my manager at work crying because I knew I was in no condition to work.  When he was finally found, he was curled up with his dog next to a car trying to stay warm.  To make it worse, the hotel charged his credit card for two nights when he wasn't even there.   The situation has caused more distress for my son and has set him back in his treatment.  He has had multiple  PTSD episodes since this event and his doctor has scheduled several back to back appointments to try to help him through this set back.  As for the dog, he had to go to the vet.  The barking could have been because he was sick.  He is now being treated by a vet.  As for me... I was so distraught over this situation.  I drove for hours looking for him and crying.",-0.12855563355563354
Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,1.0,"This hotel is one of the shabbiest and worst kept up hotels I have seen in years.  Room was dirty and worn, as was the hallways an elevator.  There is no security from the garage or elevator.  No room key is required to get up to a room, anyone can get up to rooms.

our garage entrance card did not work and we waited 40 minutes to get in late at night To park.  Then our room key did not work.  Eventually the maintenance came to let us in the room and said the keys only work 50% of the time. The staff was rude and unhelpful during all these interactions.  I would give them zero stars if I could.",-0.31428571428571433
The Westin Tampa Bay,Tampa,3.0,"Stayed here about 6-7 times over the last year as our house was in various stages of construction. The Westin, as a whole, is my go-to hotel when available as a Marriott platinum when not looking for a Ritz or more boutique property. I love the West amenities personally... Heavenly sheets, food choice, design, soaps/shampoos, etc. 

While this property has a lot of great features (bay view, starbucks, etc.), the property is somewhat tired and in need of hard good and soft goods being refreshed. There are a lot of little repairs that are needed (i.e. no plugs bedside in several of the rooms I stayed in, soap/shampoo holders loose, worn or soiled furniture, etc.) I understand not every hotel is new, but after all of my years of travel I can also tell when a property is just neglecting the details. 

The worst part is really the rude and unprofessional housekeeping. On more than one occasion I had them knocking on the door at 8 am in spite of the Do Not Disturb being on the door. On one occasion, I arrived at 2 am due to a late flight. At 8 am, they start knocking and woke me up. I answered and clearly/unhappily told the housekeeper I wouldnt be departing until noon. An hour later while I was shower, the housekeeper barged into the room -- so unprofessional. Not less than 45 minutes later, I went down to Starbucks for an espresso and breakfast sandwich to find the housekeeper in my room -- again in spite of the Do Not Disturb sign.

Three times was enough... I walked down to the front desk and let them know I was extremely unhappy. My last and final time we stayed I had to write sticky notes on the door explaining we had a baby sleeping so do not enter or knock. There is just a general lack of attention to detail and not caring about the guest experience across the guest experience. However, their Valet folks are all great and attentive! 

Most recently I started staying at The Current. Maybe some nearby competition from another Marriott property will make the management company overseeing this property step up their game.",0.052039371447266176
Holiday Inn Express & Suites Indianapolis W - Airport Area,Indianapolis,1.0,"I didn't feel welcome. The manager was working the counter when I came in to get the room I had just booked from my phone. He asked for my license plate # and when I said I would have to outside to get it , he rudely asked me "" well do you know the color of your car"". I couldn't believe it.  It seemed all the staff reflected his attitude.",0.16666666666666666
Sheraton Indianapolis City Centre Hotel,Indianapolis,1.0,"Staying at Sheraton for the IBEW which was awesome.  The room was great, the events on the 21st floor and the Lower Level were done exceptionally well.  I give high five to the service staff, face painters, and Santa clause.

DO NOT GO TO THE BAR!!!


When the circle of lights was over and our group went down to the bar.  That's when things went from amazing to tragic.  The bar service is unbelievably HORRIBLE.  I feel the whole staff either hates what they do or they are in need of retirement.  The words I will be right with you should never follow waiting 10min and then asking for service.  Then we moved to the bar thinking it would be faster and we were WAY wrong.  We got ignored yet again and only after waiting longer after asking for service and being told yet again someone would be right with us.  We watched  a group being served that came in way after us drinks.  It was very sad that the staff at this establishment could care less that they single handedly smear the Sheraton Name as the restaurant/bar represents the establishment as a whole. 

Was at the bar 11/29/2019 at 8:55pm - 9:52pm and got one drink and no food.  SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!!!",0.002997076023391837
Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,1.0,"This is not the best Marriott I have stayed at and I am a frequent traveler. I think it was Latima at the desk when I checked in, she was very rude and no help at all, the bar was closed and I asked about the salads in the cool case and she did not say, they are not available or try to sale one.  I know the hotel was not sold out, I had called the evening shift and the guy that answered the phone was very nice and accommodating, you could definitely feel the smile. I was charged $200 for the room, I felt I was overcharged by Latima, but I was tired coming in off a flight and attack I was exhausted. The room was stale, I will not stay here again I will most definitely take a uber to a nicer Hilton property. The location is a gem but the customer service and price not worth it. This property should be sold out but with people like Latima what do you expect, figure it out. On check out the Asian desk person was nice, gave us juice but I did not ask her to adjust rate. When you have bad people and management don't even know why there business is going bust. Definitely not brotherly love felt here !!! Thanks but no thanks Marriott at the airport.",0.08484375

Philadelphia Airport Marriott,Philadelphia,1.0,"Utter dump.  Expensive, rude staff, filthy facilities.  If this is what the Marriott Corp. calls a hotel, I KNOW I'm smart to stay with iHG.  They are taking advantage of us poor, tired travelers.  This P.O.S. ranks right up there with the Hilton at O'Hare.  Couple it with the PHL airport, and you have the ""Perfect Storm"" of rudeness, filth, and displeasure when traveling.  I'm only here as I have a client in this area.  It's a sad statement on our infrastructure.  A total embarrassment.  Avoid PHL if you can and if you must travel through this unpolished turd of an airport DO NOT stay at this crappy Marriott!!!!!!!!!

The Westin Tampa Bay,Tampa,1.0,"DO NOT stay here. The rooms are outrageously outdated and our dining experience couldn't have been worse. For two of us, they screwed up both of our salads 2x each (we never did receive the correct meals), one person's meal was served 10 minutes before the rest of us and the service was offensively slow and bad (completely ignored). While the manager comped our meal, there really wasn't anything to comp...as we never ate our meals. Stay away.",-0.24999999999999997
Crowne Plaza Indianapolis-Dwtn-Union Stn,Indianapolis,3.0,"This is the creepiest hotel ever. The concept of rehabbing an old train station into a hotel sounded cool but staying here was a whole other trip. The statues are creepy as they placed right in front of your room. The first two nights, I had a pair of nuns and the front desk just around the corner from my room. After a leak in the HVAC, I was moved to a room near the pool, near other statues including a little girl standing on a beam above my head. 

Customer service here is mediocre. The front desk staff are constantly clueless and rude. The housekeeping staff only clean parts of your room while throwing away items that aren't trash (like my commuter mug!). The only bright side is the maintenance crew-- Richard, who came to assess the leak, gave me a dinner comp ($75 for two at the Pullman lounge) for the hassle. 

Lastly, I found myself feeling super hot every night due to the bedding. Other colleagues staying at the hotel felt the same way. Really odd.",0.03743131868131868
